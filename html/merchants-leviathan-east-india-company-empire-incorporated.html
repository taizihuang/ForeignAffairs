Titled <i>The Atrocities at Amboyna</i>, the painting depicted the torture and beheading of ten English merchants by Dutch agents for allegedly trying to usurp control of the region’s lucrative spice trade. Even with Greenbury’s changes, the painting inflamed public fury, directed at London’s Dutch citizens, who appealed to King Charles I’s Privy Council for protection. The painting was so incendiary that after just two weeks on display at the company’s headquarters, the king ordered it removed, and it was never seen in public again.</p><p>But the memory of the events at Amboyna endured. Between 1624 and 1781, the East India Company published a dozen times a pamphlet titled <i>A True Relation of the Unjust, Cruel, and Barbarous Proceedings Against the English</i>, complete with two powerful woodcut frontispieces that depicted Dutch interrogators torturing with fire and water the English merchants, now martyrs. The Amboyna Massacre, as it was known, became part of the company’s and, by extension, the British Empire’s origin story in Asia. Defeat at Amboyna and the cruel deaths of its merchants steered the company away from the East Indian spice trade and competition with the powerful Dutch monopoly trading company, the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or VOC. Instead, the East India Company turned to cotton and silk textile trading with the Mughal Empire in South Asia, eventually expanding its lucrative trade to commodities such as tea and the illegal trafficking of opium while extending its reach across the Indian subcontinent and into the Persian Gulf, China, and elsewhere in Asia.</p><p>What began in the ignominy at Amboyna would end in the creation of a globe-spanning empire and the modern world as we know it. The East India Company, arguably the most enduring public-private partnership in history, helped make the British Empire, fuel the industrialization of Europe, and knit together the global economy. It was chief among dozens of other chartered companies granted monopoly rights and sovereign claims through politically issued charters. These companies, the avatars of the crown, merged the pursuit of profit with the prerogatives of governance, although, much like the VOC, they often governed as they pleased, without legally enforceable responsibilities. Importing raw materials, they fed the Industrial Revolution’s manufacturing sector, stimulated demand for foreign products, and dominated London’s burgeoning capital markets while also undertaking the state’s bidding in establishing the British Empire. Chartered companies helped claim nearly a third of the world’s territory for the United Kingdom, making its empire the largest ever known.</p><p>Scholars have long debated the significance and lingering impact of these imperial-era firms. Some analysts, focusing on profit and scale, see present-day corporate behemoths as contemporary manifestations of chartered companies. Others see the largest of them all, the East India Company, as even more powerful: one BBC writer saw it as “the CIA, the NSA, and the biggest, baddest multinational corporation on earth,” whose power, much like that of a company such as Meta, went virtually unchecked for years. Chartered companies often existed beyond the reach of state regulation and in many ways functioned as states in their own right, with their own forms of sovereignty. Their legacy extends to contemporary tensions between hefty multinational technology corporations and the countries that struggle to restrain them.</p><p>Philip Stern’s landmark book, <i>Empire, Incorporated: The Corporations That Built British Colonialism</i>, resists facile comparisons between today’s multinational corporate giants and the chartered companies of yesteryear. It traces the evolution over four centuries of the British Empire’s joint-stock corporations, the East India Company among them, and their role in the state’s imperial designs, what Stern calls “corporate colonialism.” Urging his readers to reflect “on the present quandaries of public and private power more through genealogy than analogy,” Stern painstakingly demonstrates how joint-stock “venture colonialism” financed and shaped the British Empire, forging legacies that endure to the present day.</p><h3>THE RISE OF THE CHARTERS</h3><p>Born from incessant warfare, the East India Company and the VOC became two of the most powerful corporations the world has ever known. Both were granted chartered monopolies—the East India Company in 1600 from Queen Elizabeth I and the VOC in 1602 from the States General of the recently founded Dutch Republic—and possessed powers typically associated with sovereign states, including the right to build forts, raise armies, mint currency, wage war, sign treaties, and engage in diplomacy with non-European entities.</p><div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile"><script data-cfasync="false" src="/cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">

In Amsterdam, paintings by grandmasters such as Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer adorned the era, and pathbreaking ideas, including those of the philosophers Baruch Spinoza and Hugo Grotius, spread far and wide. In London, imported commodities contributed to the growth of domestic manufacturing and the emergence of an urban middle class. Many at the time, including the conservative politician and thinker Edmund Burke, saw the fortunes of the East India Company and those of Great Britain as being inextricably linked. The VOC emerged as the first publicly listed company, paying average yearly dividends of 18 percent for almost two centuries. At its height, the VOC was worth the equivalent of around $7.9 trillion in today’s dollars—a figure greater than the combined current valuations of Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Facebook, Johnson &amp; Johnson, McDonald’s, Netflix, Samsung, Tencent, Visa, Walmart, and Wells Fargo.</p><p>The East India Company evolved into a permanent joint-stock company in 1657. Much like modern corporations, it had the legal status of a person with rights but few obligations, transferable shares, limited liability, and a separation between management (the directors) and owners (the shareholders). As with the VOC, anyone could invest in the enterprise of imperial commerce, at once profiting financially and staking a nationalist claim to overseas power. By the early nineteenth century, the East India Company had a private army of 200,000 (twice the size of the United Kingdom’s), accounted for nearly half the country’s trade, and ruled over the bulk of the Indian subcontinent. Shareholders annually elected merchant-statesmen who crafted and implemented policy, determining the fates of millions who were beholden to the company.</p><p><figure class="article-inline-img-block print-hidden"><img alt="" class="w-100" height="380" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (min-width: 768px) 50vw" src="../image/1_GettyImages-2673553.jpg.webp" srcset="../image/1_GettyImages-2673553.jpg.webp" width="570"/><figcaption class="article-inline-img-block--figcaption ls-narrow f-sans mt-2 print-hidden"><div class="article-inline-img-block--caption">The Mughal emperor of India surrendering Bengal to agents of the British East India Company in 1765</div> <address class="article-inline-img-block--photo-credit">Hulton Archive / Getty Images</address> </figcaption></figure></p><p>The VOC and the East India Company blurred the lines between public and private in pursuit of profit and power. They were not alone. European states chartered and assisted scores of private companies that, in turn, provided the twin engines of imperial and capitalist expansion around the globe. In England’s march to amass its empire, the Muscovy Company was granted its charter in 1555, followed by the Levant Company in 1592, the East India Company, the Virginia Company in 1606, the Newfoundland Company in 1610, the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1670, and the Royal African Company in 1672. There were scores of other chartered companies that were granted monopoly rights and that financed and drove the earliest attempts to found English colonies and profit from trade in all manner of raw materials as well as enslaved peoples.</p><p>English merchants, laying the economic and political foundations of empire, nonetheless relied on state intervention to guarantee their access to markets. Gunboats kept the doors of trade open in, for instance, China during the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century. The navy policed colonial waters, protecting merchant shipping, especially after the Battle of Lagos, a devastating loss in 1693 of a convoy of merchant ships in the Mediterranean at the hands of the French. The disaster helped fuel subsequent British defense spending, almost half of it going to the navy.</p><p>Protective tariffs also supported the trading companies’ commerce at home while helping to finance their military activities overseas. Imperial companies contributed handsomely to the state coffers through customs duties, with just five chartered companies, principally the East India Company, accounting for about a third of Great Britain’s customs duties in the mid-eighteenth century. The chartered companies also helped generate large-scale employment, whether in London’s ports or on the high seas and the battlefields of empire. The Levant Company alone employed some 5,000 sailors by the end of the seventeenth century, and by the early nineteenth century, the East India Company would amass an enormous private security force far greater than that of most states.</p><h3>Venture Colonialism</h3><p>There is arguably no single scholar more well versed, incisive, and thought provoking than Stern in analyzing the evolution of joint-stock corporations in the British Empire. His first book, <i>The Company-State </i>(2011), is among the most important volumes dissecting the business model of the East India Company from its founding at the start of the seventeenth century to the Battle of Plassey in 1757, after which the company cemented its position as the ruler of much of Bengal. Armed with a charter granting it broad rights from the Cape of Good Hope to the Strait of Magellan, the company in its first 150 years was, in Stern’s words, a “company-state,” or a “commercial, political, and diplomatic intermediary” between England and its growing empire in the East. Fending off demands for “free trade” and an end to state-sponsored monopolism and mercantilist policy, the company insisted its monopoly was in truth a civic-oriented enterprise, the handmaiden for England’s economic prosperity and global power.</p><div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--2"><script type="text/javascript">

</script></div></div><p>With <i>Empire, Incorporated</i>, Stern takes in the entirety of British “company-states,” moving beyond sovereigns and statesmen, understanding that empire depended on investors, creditors, convicts, entrepreneurs, landowners, and embezzlers, among others, as much as on politicians. “Their efforts produced,” according to Stern, “what one might call venture colonialism, a particularly prolific, if controversial, brand of overseas expansion that was bound across four centuries by the conviction that the public business of empire was and had always been best done by private enterprise.” The crucial medium through which private enterprise did its work in empire was the joint-stock corporation, which, by Stern’s telling, shaped “British colonialism from its sixteenth-century origins through the era of decolonization” and, with it, “would endure to exert an inordinate influence in and over the modern world.” These companies signed treaties, made territorial claims, subdued and exploited local populations, and lined the pockets of European investors while often operating like states with transnational reach, as opposed to subjects governed by laws and obligations. In so doing, they laid the foundations for the future economic and political imbalance between the West and the rest of the world.</p><p></p><blockquote class="internal-blockquote offset ls-narrow"> The East India Company helped make the British Empire and knit together the global economy.</blockquote><p><i>Empire, Incorporated</i> is, at once, a history of the modern joint-stock corporation as well as an important and bold reframing of the history of the British Empire. Beginning with the incorporation of the Muscovy Company, the British firm founded to trade with Russia and the first ever English joint-stock company, and ending with the 1982 Falklands War, Stern ranges broadly from the so-called discoveries of New England by European explorers in the sixteenth century and the nascent plantation systems of the Caribbean to the South Sea Bubble of 1720 and the interior of East Africa in the nineteenth century, clearly showing how joint-stock corporations “pooled resources, risk, management, self-regulation, and rights” to reach incredible scales in their overseas ventures. Throughout, Stern never loses sight of how difficult it is to locate any clear dividing line between commercial and state activity. Corporations did not merely play a supporting role in any kind of public-private partnership, but they often took the lead in the expansion and administration of empires. Stern suggests that governments may have to begin imagining today’s multinational giants, such as Google and Microsoft, in terms reminiscent of the East India Company; not as subjects to be dictated to by states, but as actors with rights and obligations not unlike those of states.</p><p><i>Empire, Incorporated</i> sketches a vivid reimagining of the corporation, illuminating individuals who played outsize roles in the pursuit of profit and power. Thomas Smythe, the chief architect of British mercantilism in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was not only a founder of the East India Company, but he also served as a governor for the Muscovy Company and the Levant Company and served as the Virginia Company’s treasurer. As the joint-stock corporations evolved overseas, Smythe was among the founders of what would become the British Empire, as important as any statesman, if not more so, in creating templates—or, in entrepreneurial terms, proofs of concept—that were reproduced over and over again for four centuries. Smythe’s efforts in the early modern era influenced later business titans, such as Cecil Rhodes and his British South African Company in the nineteenth century. Much like Smythe, Rhodes—as chairman of the De Beers diamond company, joint managing director of the Goldfields of South Africa Company, prime minister of the Cape Colony, and managing director of the British South Africa Company, which colonized through violent means present-day Zimbabwe—was a businessman, politician, and empire builder whose chartered company, in Stern’s analysis, “secured its financial power with political power and vice versa.”</p><h3>Private Despots</h3><p>Recasting the British Empire as a story of “corporate colonialism,” as Stern does, still leaves only a partial picture. David Livingstone, the famed nineteenth-century British missionary and explorer, summed up the United Kingdom’s imperial credo in three words: Christianity, commerce, and civilization. Stern’s work may be masterful on the topic of commerce, but it does not delve much into the realm of ideas. The imperatives of power and profit certainly drove company-states, much as they do corporations today. But company-states in the age of empire did not operate in ideological vacuums, nor do modern-day corporations. The United Kingdom’s nineteenth-century civilizing mission, although rarely mentioned in Stern’s work, was an article of faith at home and in the empire. It compelled countless missionaries, such as Livingstone, to spread the gospel and Western norms around the globe, while baby-faced colonial administrators set out to refashion the empire’s subjects in the United Kingdom’s liberal image. This sense of noblesse oblige, however misplaced, partly fueled condemnations of the company-state, reflecting tensions that endure today. One just needs to consider calls to reimagine capitalism, like those expressed at the Obama Foundation’s first Democracy Forum in 2022, and the wrangling over issues such as corporate social responsibility that can pit the profit motive against a sense of liberal purpose.</p><p>Indeed, the East India Company was not above reproach, nor was it eternal. It drew plenty of ire in its day—a point Stern scarcely explores—and eventually found itself subdued and snuffed out by the British state. As early as the seventeenth century, an English member of parliament described chartered companies as “bloodsuckers of the commonwealth.” Their destructive behavior extended to local populations through famine-inducing measures, exploitative labor policies, and scorched-earth tactics. The economist Adam Smith derided state-sponsored joint-stock companies for their “negligence and profusion,” insisting they were holdovers from a bygone era of capitalist organization that stymied economic growth and gave rise to gross mismanagement and abuse. Burke spearheaded the impeachment trial of Warren Hastings, the East India Company’s governor-general of Bengal, in the House of Lords, outraged not by Great Britain’s imperial ambition but with Hasting’s conduct and that of East India Company officials, whom Burke derided. “School boys without tutors, minors without guardians,” he said at the trial. “The world is let loose upon them, with all its temptations; and they are let loose upon the world, with all the powers that despotism involves.” Parliament, particularly after the East India Company’s fiscal crisis and massive government bailout in the 1770s, insisted on diminishing the company’s corporate sovereignty, replacing it with increased oversight until, in the aftermath of the seismic rebellion in India in 1857, it nationalized the company’s administration under the aegis of the British crown. Less than 20 years later, the company was dissolved, although its corrupt practices—“a form of laundering racket mixed with what might later be called a Ponzi or pyramid scheme,” according to Stern—lived on in the empire’s other company-states, as well as in some of today’s multinational corporations.</p><p><figure class="article-inline-img-block print-hidden"><img alt="" class="w-100" height="380" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (min-width: 768px) 50vw" src="../image/2_GettyImages-1160953957.jpg.webp" srcset="" width="570"/><figcaption class="article-inline-img-block--figcaption ls-narrow f-sans mt-2 print-hidden"><div class="article-inline-img-block--caption">The first fleet of the East India Company leaving Woolwich, England, 1601</div> <address class="article-inline-img-block--photo-credit">Artist Unknown / The Print Collector / Getty Images</address> </figcaption></figure></p><p>In 1896, <i>The Spectator</i> said the “joint-stock system of exploitation and government . . . [which had been] glorified into a religion by prophets who are carried beyond the bounds of reason by their zeal in the cause of a powerful group of financiers.” Later, in the aftermath of the South African War of 1899–1902, the imperial critic John Hobson chafed at companies such as Rhodes’s in southern Africa, saying such an enterprise was “little else than private despotism rendered more than usually precarious in that it has been established for the sake of dividends.”</p><div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--3"><script type="text/javascript">

</script></div></div><p>But what was this despotism? Stern largely avoids the question, leaving <i>Empire, Incorporated</i> reading more, at times, like an annual report than a critique of the exploits of joint-stock corporations in the British Empire. Indeed, readers will not glean here what underlies modern debates about the symbols and legacies of empire, such as the Rhodes Must Fall movement at Oxford University (where students want the institution to disown Rhodes and his colonial baggage) or the protests in Bristol in 2020 that toppled the statue of Edward Colston, the director of the Royal African Company who oversaw the forcible transport of around 85,000 Africans to the Americas. That may be an admirable quality of the book: more facts, less polemics. Stern’s analysis, nevertheless, lacks the unflinching examination of the East India Company’s cruelties and chaos that readers can find, for instance, in William Dalrymple’s <i>The Anarchy</i>. By comparison, Stern’s account<i> </i>sanitizes the record of European company-states, which were directly responsible for unspeakable atrocities, including famine, torture, rape, murder, and enslavement.</p><p>Gargantuan private companies today occasionally liken their size and success to yesteryear’s corporate behemoths. Former Google executive Dan Doctoroff called Alphabet, Google’s parent company, the “single most ambitious company that has ever existed,” with the possible exception of the “Dutch East India Company, [which] had the power to wage war.” But others condemn the postcolonial dimensions of today’s capitalism, sometimes pairing present-day market forces with latter-day historical injustices to drum up outrage. Anupam Mittal, People Group’s founder and CEO, bristled at Google’s new billing system, calling the corporate giant the “Digital East India Company” and its policies “neocolonialism at its worst,” likening its commissions to <i>lagaan</i>, a tribute that Indian serfs in centuries past paid from their harvests to feudal lords.</p><p></p><blockquote class="internal-blockquote offset ls-narrow"> Governments today must learn from the global giants that funded and drove Europe’s empires.</blockquote><p>Governments and corporations today can and must learn from the global giants that funded and drove Europe’s empires. These companies, launched as capitalist enterprises, rapidly became public-private partnerships, acquiring and maintaining territory while transcending sovereign boundaries and often remaining at arm’s length from the laws of sovereign states. Much like some of today’s multinational corporations, they were masterful at lobbying, bribing, and creating new company structures and forms to avoid state-driven legislation that, more often than not, failed to rein them in. The U.S. Congress’s recent questioning of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s outsize influence on political outcomes had certain parallels with Burke’s eighteenth-century interrogation of Hastings in Parliament.</p><p>Such necessary critiques can be unsatisfying in the face of global existential crises that demand solutions rather than handwringing and finger wagging. Whether it be the East India Company or Facebook, multinational companies have often exploited state weaknesses and outright failure. One just needs to cast an eye at today’s global commons—from technological infrastructure and mass digital communication to basic needs such as food and financial credit—to see the ways in which states are failing and dependent on public-private partnerships, often fully outsourcing some responsibilities to private actors. Multinational corporations will play an essential role in finding solutions for the crucial issues of the age, including climate change, inequality, and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Stern offers, in an earlier essay, a possible path forward. The centuries-old lesson from the East India Company and others like it is to acknowledge the limitations of domestic and municipal laws in reining in multinational corporations that operate with state-like power and influence. Perhaps it’s time to reimagine, in Stern’s words, “global governance . . . to include corporations not as subjects but as actors” whose “rights and obligations” are regulated by international law.</p><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span></noscript></div></div><div class="paywall v-2019-max mb-3"><div class="container"><div class="paywall-prompt"><h3 class="paywall-head mb-1">You are reading a free article.</h3><h4 class="paywall-subhead font-weight-normal">Subscribe to <em>Foreign Affairs</em> to get unlimited access.</h4><ul class="paywall-list list-unstyled"><li class="paywall-list-item"> Paywall-free reading of new articles and over a century of archives</li><li class="paywall-list-item"> Unlock access to iOS/Android apps to save editions for offline reading</li><li class="paywall-list-item"> Six issues a year in print, online, and audio editions</li></ul> <a class="paywall-cta-btn btn btn-outline-light mt-2" href="/subscribe?s=WTZZZZZZZX" title="Subscribe Now"> Subscribe Now </a></div></div></div></div><ul class="authors-bio px-3 pt-3 pb-2 list-unstyled" id="author-info"><li class="mb-3" id="author-bio-1"><div class="authors-bio__body mb-0"> CAROLINE ELKINS is Thomas Henry Carroll/Ford Foundation Professor at Harvard Business School and Professor of History and of African and African American Studies at Harvard University.
