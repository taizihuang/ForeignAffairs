<p>If the attacks of September 11, 2001, changed  everything, then it is also true that some things changed more quickly than others.  Within a year and a half, the United States fought one war and prepared for another,  and Congress passed two sweeping bills, the U.S.A. Patriot Act and the Homeland  Security Act, to address the war on terrorism's domestic front. But it took  more than three years, a best-selling report, and a bruising fight on Capitol Hill  for Congress to pass a bill addressing the issue of intelligence failure. That legislation,  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, was signed by President George  W. Bush in December 2004 and hailed by many intelligence reform advocates as a major  victory. Its core innovations included the creation of a new director of national  intelligence (DNI) and the charter of a national counterterrorism center, two  recommendations of the 9/11 Commission that sought to remedy insufficient information  sharing within the long-fractured intelligence community and establish more coherence  in setting and meeting priorities.</p>
<p>This transformation owed much to the 9/11  Commission and the victims' families who backed it. Its gripping report concluded  with a set of proposals for overhauling not just the spy agencies but congressional  oversight as well. Rather than disbanding after issuing its report, the commissioners  kept the heat on Congress and the White House through the summer and autumn of 2004.  The momentum of the report, combined with a unique convergence of political forces,  paved the way for a set of reforms that had previously lacked the traction to succeed  in getting implemented.</p>
<p>This achievement is all the more remarkable  given that between the end of the Cold War and the September 11 attacks, no fewer  than six independent commissions and three government reviews tackled intelligence  reform -- all to no avail. One long-standing concern was that the CIA director  also served as the titular head of the 14 other agencies in the intelligence community,  most of which are in the Pentagon, even though he effectively lacked control over  their budgets or personnel. This "dual hatting" meant that no one was  really in charge of the intelligence community. Other experts warned that spy agencies  had not successfully reconfigured themselves to meet the amorphous challenges of  the post-Cold War world, terrorism chief among them.</p>
<p>The September 11 attacks threw these  issues into bold relief while also highlighting the need for better human intelligence  and tighter cooperation among agencies -- especially between foreign intelligence  collection and domestic counterterrorism efforts. Congress finished its own September  11 inquiry in 2003 with a bipartisan report that called for, among other things,  an end to the CIA director's dual hatting through the creation of a more  powerful DNI. Yet once again, efforts responding to these recommendations languished  in the Republican-controlled Congress, stymied by quiet resistance from the White  House, the Pentagon, and the Pentagon's allies on Capitol Hill. Since the Defense  Department's intelligence agencies get the biggest piece of the pie -- around  80 percent of the total intelligence budget -- there was deeply ingrained opposition  to the idea of a strong DNI who could divert resources out of the Defense Department  into other intelligence agencies, including the CIA. (The total budget remains  classified but is thought to come to around $42 billion.) And with wars under way  in Afghanistan and Iraq, this bureaucratic concern eventually meshed with a strategic  argument: any attempt that might interfere with the Pentagon's intelligence  budget would harm U.S. troops on the ground.</p>

</div><p>Against this backdrop, the passage  of a sweeping intelligence reform bill was a political feat of the highest order.  The first-ever DNI, former Ambassador John Negroponte, was confirmed in May and  has since set up shop and introduced several reforms in such products as the Presidential  Daily Brief and the National Intelligence Estimates. Another panel, Bush's  Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons  of Mass Destruction, issued its own report last March, which included recommendations  for fine-tuning the intelligence bill's provisions. Most of those were implemented  through executive order in June.</p>
<p>But the battle over the bill and its  aftermath have underscored a more pessimistic reality: the resilience of turf protection  and bureaucratic self-preservation in Washington. The bitter, drawn-out congressional  fight preceding the bill's passage made clear just how ambivalent the political  will for reform was, even in the aftermath of the successful report by the 9/11  Commission. Just as problematic was Congress' failure to reorganize its committees  and beef up oversight of the spy agencies when it had the chance, which left it  poorly positioned to follow through on this legislation and oversee Negroponte's  attempts to carve out his new powers. Negroponte has drawn praise for his diplomatic  skills, but concern is growing that the former diplomat is better suited to forging  smooth relations with the powers that be than making hard decisions on structural  reform. And only those hard decisions can address the ongoing problems with interagency  cooperation and information sharing. As with any legislation, the success of the  intelligence bill depends largely on its implementation. But in this case, the political  momentum to build on initial gains is running out of steam just at the critical  point.</p>
<p>WHERE YOU STAND IS WHERE  YOU SIT</p>
<p>The congressional battle over intelligence  reform was distinctive in several respects. Rather than Republicans pitted against  Democrats, a bipartisan group of senators squared off against House Republicans.  The catalyst was a report by an outside commission, not the advocacy of the White  House or a particular lawmaker. What was typical, however, was the fierceness of  the turf battle that ensued, both in public and in secret conference talks.</p>
<p>The 9/11 Commission's bipartisanship  was a defining part of its strategy. Two well-regarded moderates, Republican Thomas  Kean and Democrat Lee Hamilton, headed the panel's ideologically diverse ten-member  team, which was split between the two parties. The report's narrative provided  exhaustive detail about intelligence failures in both the Clinton and Bush administrations  without openly pinning blame on specific individuals. And after the report's  release, the commissioners focused their efforts on getting Congress to act on its  proposals rather than on retrospective finger-pointing.</p>
<p>This strategy yielded impressive results  in terms of both public opinion and traction in the Senate. Polls showed that the  commission had a high standing among Democrats and Republicans alike -- with approval  ratings above 60 percent -- and its report sold phenomenally well. In the GOP-controlled  Senate, meanwhile, the centrist leaders of the Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), crafted  a robust intelligence overhaul bill within two and a half months of the report's  July 2004 publication. The bill hewed closely to the commission's proposals,  establishing a DNI with strong budget powers, a national counterterrorism center,  and a unified and declassified intelligence appropriation. After bringing onboard  powerful skeptics such as Senate Armed Services Committee Chair John Warner (R-Va.),  the Collins-Lieberman bill swept through the Senate with a vote of 96-2.</p>
<p>But a far more cautious reaction came  from the White House. It was a month after the report's release before Bush  first issued a vague statement on its proposals, expressing support for a DNI  with "strong budget authority" but rejecting a declassified budget. In  contrast to John Kerry, he avoided the subject of intelligence reform throughout  the 2004 election. Both Democrats and Republicans close to the bill's negotiations  say that the White House did come around in August 2004 to accepting the political  need for an intelligence reform bill but that it was a decision wrought by pragmatism  rather than conviction. "The White House saw the writing on the wall, so they  decided to make lemonade out of lemons," is how Senate Intelligence Committee  Chair Pat Roberts (R-Kans.) put it.</p>

</div><p>If the White House's reaction  was tepid, the response among most House Republicans ranged from skeptical to hostile.  This opposition did not arise in reaction to the carefully neutral 9/11 Commission  report itself but as a response to the commission's confrontations with the  administration and its GOP allies on the Hill over the course of its investigation.  The White House and most congressional Republicans initially opposed the panel's  creation in 2002. After they had started their probe, the commissioners had to bargain  hard for limited access to the highly classified Presidential Daily Brief, for getting  then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to testify under oath, and for more  funding to continue working past their initial deadline. Perhaps most dramatic was  an unsuccessful attempt by some congressional Republicans in the spring of 2004  to make Democratic Commissioner and former Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick  step down and testify on her alleged role in building the "wall" between  intelligence and law enforcement in the mid-1990s -- a part of the investigation  from which she had already recused herself and a charge that the report itself largely  debunked.</p>
<p>The core issue for some House Republicans  was the commission's basic composition and its mandate to include the Bush  White House in its probe. Most were furious over the tough questioning that the  Democratic commissioners forced on Bush administration officials such as Rice, not  to mention the blistering public testimony by former counterterrorism official Richard  Clarke. As one GOP source close to the House leadership put it, "Our guys  in the rank and file just didn't like the feel of the commission. The process  was tainted by its Democratic composition, which caused a lot of uneasiness. [Commissioner  Timothy] Roemer had this close association with the September 11 families and House  Democrats. Clarke also really pissed people off."</p>
<p>Some Republicans went so far as to  charge that the commission endangered national security. House Majority Leader Tom  DeLay (R-Tex.) warned in April 2004 that "the politicization of the commission  undermines the war effort and endangers our troops." Others made more personal  attacks. Representative Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) blasted the panel as "a reunion  of political has-beens who haven't had face time since Seinfeld was a weekly  show."</p>
<p>So from the start, with the exception  of a small group of moderate northeasterners, House Republicans indicated that they  would take their own time, and go their own way, in crafting a bill. Many Republican  House members immediately warned that the Senate legislation would undermine the  war effort. Led by House Armed Services Committee Chair Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.)  and House Judiciary Committee Chair James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), and flanked by  the House Republican leadership, this group quashed a bipartisan effort to pass a  House bill similar to the Collins-Lieberman version in the Senate. That move paved  the way for the House to push through a GOP-written bill in October that watered  down the DNI's authorities and included a slew of provisions on immigration  and law enforcement that were neither in the 9/11 Commission report nor in the Senate  bill.</p>
<p>Thus began the bruising conference  negotiations to reconcile the House and Senate intelligence bills. Although a majority  of all conferees -- Republican and Democratic senators as well as House Democrats -- backed  the Collins-Lieberman version, the intelligence bill needed the support of a majority  of conferees from each chamber to pass. House GOP intransigence, accordingly,  was a critical sticking point. Although House Republican negotiators eventually  dropped their provisions on immigration and law enforcement, wrangling over the  DNI's authority to spend, hire, and fire -- the three pillars of power  in Washington -- stymied conference talks through the fall, past the November  election, and into a lame-duck session.</p>
<p>At that point, House Republicans got  more wind in their sails. The election confirmed that the White House and both chambers  would remain in Republican hands -- and with a more conservative majority at that.  Meanwhile, the leaders of the 9/11 Commission began making comments that appeared  to tilt more favorably toward the House bill. Both developments put the Senate negotiators  on more precarious footing. As one Senate aide close to the talks put it, "The  commissioners misread what was going on and didn't pressure the House Republicans  to move. The fundamental error was to think that you could get the House Republicans  to move if you said enough nice things about the bill. But instead that gave the  House an excuse not to act, because they could say, 'The commission thinks  our bill is good, too.'"</p>
<p>Thus emboldened, Hunter and his allies  stalled talks once again after the election, again citing the needs of U.S. troops  in battle -- even though the Senate negotiators had already made concessions.  One critical compromise was to back off from the 9/11 Commission's proposal  to declassify the intelligence budget and give it a separate, unified appropriation  rather than keep the traditional practice of parceling out the intelligence budget  in various spending bills and hiding it in classified, "black" accounts.  Nor did it placate House Republicans that the Senate bill never even gave the DNI  budgetary control over tactical and joint military intelligence, the kind of real-time  information that soldiers need on the ground. But those provisions were not enough  to shake Hunter and his allies. Even House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) underestimated  the solidity of his caucus' position. After the speaker announced shortly before  Thanksgiving that a compromise had been reached, Hunter refused to endorse the deal,  forcing negotiators back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>It was to the surprise of many, then,  when negotiators reached a deal in early December. Conventional wisdom at the time  credited a last-gasp offer by Collins and Lieberman: new language that guaranteed  the president would issue guidelines to make sure that the DNI would not "abrogate  the statutory responsibilities" of other departments. In fact, that language  did not substantially change the legal authorities of the DNI, as they had already  been spelled out in the bill. Rather, shifting political dynamics brought about  the deal. As sources close to the talks on both sides saw it, the White House would  have been embarrassed by the prospect of a failed bill after Bush's electoral  triumph, while Senate negotiators were all the more willing to acquiesce before  the more conservative 109th Congress took over in January. Hence, the compromise  language gave all sides what they needed, if not what they wanted: House Republicans  got face-saving language, and everyone else got a DNI bill. But the tortuous  negotiations and the bill's near death highlighted the fragility of the political  will behind this progress. The report and the efforts of the 9/11 Commission succeeded  in moving Congress and the White House, but only so far. In the end, House Republicans  succeeded in redrafting the bill so that it came much closer to meeting their terms.  Intelligence reform had reached its high-water mark and would go no further.</p>

</div><p>Among the bill's most important provisions  is the one granting the DNI significant powers over money and people. Although  the legislation does not grant the DNI his own unified intelligence budget, it  gives him authority on paper to develop and execute around 80 percent of intelligence  spending, including the budgets of the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency,  and the intelligence shops of the FBI and the Departments of State, Homeland  Security, Energy, and the Treasury. That authority also extends to the biggest part  of the intelligence budget, namely, the money for the Pentagon's national collection  agencies: the National Security Agency (which handles communications intercepts),  the National Reconnaissance Office (satellites), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence  Agency (photography and maps). Budgetary execution is a particularly important power -- and  one that the CIA director never had except over his own agency -- because it  lets the DNI control the pace of funding once appropriated funds flow from the  Treasury Department to the various agencies. In practical terms, it means that once  Congress has written the checks, the DNI can direct money to those programs he  thinks need the money the soonest.</p>
<p>The bill also grants the DNI the right  to transfer unilaterally a capped amount of money and personnel among agencies,  the power to name a deputy DNI with four deputies of his own, and the authority  to concur in the nominations of the chiefs of the ten agencies under his authority.  The DNI's office absorbed the CIA's National Intelligence Council  (the think tank that coordinates the National Intelligence Estimates) and the new  National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC (which had previously been parked  at the CIA as well, where it was called the Terrorist Threat Integration Center).  But the CIA also came out well despite the shakeup. During the restructuring  that followed the bill's passage, the CIA won the exclusive authority to  manage all overseas human intelligence collection, including that of the Pentagon  and the FBI. In addition, the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, not the  DNI or the NCTC, remains in charge of disrupting terror plots abroad.</p>
<p>The streamlining of authority under  the purview of the DNI was not matched, however, in the legislative branch. Pointing  out that oversight of the budget for the Department of Homeland Security was split  among 88 different committees and subcommittees, the 9/11 Commission report recommended  the creation of strong homeland security committees in both houses of Congress and  the consolidation of authorizing and appropriating powers for the intelligence committees,  which write the intelligence authorization bills but effectively lack full control  over the actual budget. The latter move would have also facilitated the implementation  of the commission's proposal for a single, unified intelligence appropriation  and ended the practice of chopping up the intelligence budget into secret accounts.  Later on, some lawmakers also floated the idea of creating a subcommittee for intelligence  on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, another way to streamline the  intelligence budget process.</p>
<p>Congress had a chance to make progress  on these proposals while negotiators were hammering out the details of the reform  bill, but the reorganization attempt fizzled immediately. Virtually none of the  9/11 Commission's recommendations for Congress itself have been adopted. Appropriators  refused to cede any power to the intelligence committees or to entertain the idea  of creating an intelligence appropriations subcommittee, which would have likely  diminished the power of one subcommittee on appropriations (Defense) and eliminated  another (Military Construction). The House, which has a weak homeland security committee,  failed to beef up that panel's authorization powers, while the Senate, which  had had no homeland security committee at all, decided to give only very modest  jurisdiction over homeland security to Collins and Lieberman's committee, limiting  its purview to functions outside of transportation security, immigration, and the  Coast Guard -- the three biggest items in the Department of Homeland Security's  budget.</p>
<p>The failures of congressional reorganization  received little press coverage, but the implications are serious. First, the continuation  of the status quo keeps intact the unusual degree of control over the intelligence  budget by appropriators (who write the checks in the end) rather than authorizers  (who write the bills outlining their respective budgets), even though only the latter  have a full staff of experts at their disposal. Second, the continuation of the status  quo makes it more difficult for Negroponte and his successors to count on a unified  budget process, since it forces the DNI to deal with multiple actors rather than  a few individuals. That splintering of jurisdiction, in turn, will make any future  attempts at intelligence reform more difficult to push through Congress. Third and  last, the decision to keep the intelligence budget split up among separate, classified  accounts means that appropriators themselves cannot transfer money among their respective  subcommittees -- say, from Defense over to the State Department's Bureau  of Intelligence and Research or to the FBI to aid its counterterrorism efforts -- even  if they decide that such a transfer reflects an important priority. Coordination  of the intelligence budget, in short, remains as unwieldy as it was before.</p>
<p>A Republican member of the 9/11 Commission,  John Lehman, put the problem this way: "Let's say Negroponte decides to  make some fundamental changes. He can do all he wants, but the intelligence authorization  bill will still have to go through several committees and get tangled up in a very  complicated process with appropriations. There have to be at least two enlightened  players for any rational progress to be made. But there's no one person the  DNI can go to on the Hill." One main reason why this conundrum remains is  related to the reform bill's compromise to keep the total amount of the intelli-gence  budget secret -- a tactically necessary concession by the Senate because both  the White House and the House Republicans rejected the idea of budget declassification  from the start. The latter argued that terrorist groups and other enemies would  gain too much knowledge about U.S. intelligence through the disclosure of its budget,  whereas the Senate negotiators and the 9/11 Commission dismissed that threat as  an unjustified excuse to keep large sums of money out of the view of congressional  oversight and out of the public eye. The then interim CIA director, John McLaughlin,  had even given a yellow light for declassification during a congressional hearing.  But the proposal was a nonstarter, and the Senate compromise effectively killed with  one stone the push for a unified budget for the DNI and a more unified intelligence  budget process in Congress. The creation of an intelligence appropriations subcommittee  or an intelligence committee with appropriating authorities would have led to a  unified intelligence budget, and a unified budget is effectively a declassified one.  (With a unified intelligence budget, it takes only simple arithmetic to figure out  the total once the president submits his annual budget request. Conversely, chopping  up the intelligence budget keeps it secret by allowing smaller slices of the pie  to be hidden as classified accounts in large spending bills.)</p>
<p>The perpetuation of secrecy has other  implications as well. It means that lawmakers have great difficulty bringing up any  intelligence-related amendments to the House or Senate floor once a bill is out  of committee, because doing so could violate congressional rules barring the disclosure  of classified information. More broadly, it also means that Congress and the American  public cannot have an open debate about intelligence priorities. And by keeping  the intelligence committees relatively weak -- no power of the purse, no way to  amend spending bills, no appropriation subcommittee to coordinate the budget -- Congress  left those panels poorly equipped to act as a check on abuses or failings within  the intelligence agencies. Accordingly, the prospects for stronger congressional  oversight of intelligence remain bleak. Kean, chair of the 9/11 Commission, put  it this way: "Only Congress can hold the intelligence agencies accountable,  and that's why it has to function effectively. ... Negroponte might be doing  the job with the support of the president, but we have a problem finding out whether  he can do it at all since this is behind closed doors. No one else can fix this  but Congress, and if Congress can't fix it, then there's no one to make  sure Negroponte can do his job."</p>
<p>LEARNING TO SHARE</p>
<p>One of the critical failures highlighted by  the 9/11 Commission report was the disastrous lack of communication among various  intelligence agencies -- especially between the FBI and the CIA. The many  missed opportunities are by now well known. In 2000, the CIA did not alert other  agencies about the only two September 11 hijackers who were known to have al Qaeda  ties before they arrived in the United States, and later the FBI failed to devote  sufficient time and agents to pursue them. Investigators in the case of the October  2000 bombing of the U.S.S. Cole did not receive critical information from the CIA  and the FBI, and in August 2001, the FBI did not grasp the significance of  Zacarias Moussaoui's flight training, which was revealed after he was arrested  and which would have led them to press him for information about his al Qaeda links.  Whether capitalizing on these opportunities would have cracked the September 11  plot will be debated for years, but they all stand as examples of how the system  should not work.</p>

</div>
</div><p>There is widespread agreement that coordination  and information sharing have improved since the attacks. Both the creation in 2002  of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and its subsequent morphing into the  NCTC last year through the DNI bill and related executive orders have helped  coordinate intelligence analysis across agencies. The NCTC now runs daily meetings  with representatives from the CIA, the FBI, the Defense Intelligence Agency,  the National Security Agency, and the Departments of State and Homeland Security.  It also meets daily to discuss the drafting of analytic products such as the president's  daily threat report.</p>
<p>But thanks to the years of entrenched  independence of the individual agencies and a long tradition of information hoarding,  major shortcomings remain. Although the NCTC is generally regarded as an improvement  over the status quo, the status quo is a poor benchmark for comparison. NCTC  analysts have access to 26 information networks across the intelligence agencies  (housed in three computers on each analyst's desk), but there is no one database  that unites these networks, nor is it possible to conduct a search across all 26.  It was only in the autumn of 2004, three years after the attacks, that analysts  first began to be able to conduct a search across two of the networks. NCTC analysts  can share information with each other person to person, but if they wish to share  information with intelligence colleagues outside of the NCTC, they must get  the permission of the originating agency. (For example, an FBI analyst at the  center wishing to exchange intelligence with a CIA analyst outside of the NCTC  may do so, but only with official permission from the FBI.) Although that may sound  like a reasonable safeguard, "there is still a lack of understanding on what  needs to get out," according to one senior intelligence official.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Negroponte has a dizzying  "to do" list that includes responsibilities that extend beyond those he  has related to the NCTC. Intelligence sharing between special operations units  on the ground in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan and the office of the DNI  is only in an embryonic state. Conversely, state and local authorities now receive  a stream of terrorist-related information from federal agencies, but much of it  is redundant and poorly processed. There is still no single office or individual in  the intelligence community to mandate information sharing across all agencies. The  overhaul of the FBI -- whose counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and intelligence  authorities are now supposed to come under the umbrella of the DNI as one fused  unit -- poses further questions. The office of the DNI is still negotiating with  the FBI and Congress on just how robust Negroponte's powers over the FBI's  national security functions will be. The recent collapse of the bureau's unfinished  $170 million Virtual Case File computer system serves as a stark example of its  inability to move forward into the information age. Many critics also charge that  the fiercely independent bureau has not adapted its case-based law enforcement culture  to the very different needs of intelligence collection or put enough resources into  cultivating intelligence analysts, an area long seen as a backwater. Most of the  fewer than two dozen FBI analysts at the NCTC are drawn from the younger,  less experienced ranks, due to a paucity of seasoned analysts.</p>
<p>Finally, concern is growing that Negroponte's  office is simply another layer of bureaucracy over all agencies rather than a force  that can push through necessary structural changes to streamline the intelligence  community and foster more accountability. In May, Negroponte's deputy, former  chief of the National Security Agency Michael Hayden, tapped four officials for collection,  analysis, intelligence community management, and customer relations ("customer"  meaning anyone who uses intelligence, from the president to Congress). But these  officials have amorphous responsibilities covering a broad range of services rather  than responsibility over a specific agency, mission, or branch of intelligence,  and they all hold lower executive-branch ranks than the intelligence chiefs they  are supposedly overseeing. Accordingly, some critics worry, the office of the DNI  can neither ensure greater accountability nor use the muscle of its deputies to  encourage more "jointness" among the intelligence agencies. As 9/11 Commissioner  Lehman said, "This model doesn't give anybody line authority over anything.  You just have meetings and studies that focus on the process rather than the product."</p>
<p>Negroponte has been in office only since  May, but diplomacy, rather than boldness, has marked his critical first few months.  Negroponte has significant power on paper, but he has spent much energy on projects  that do little to further a bureaucratic transformation. His office has commendably  revamped plans for the Presidential Daily Brief (which Negroponte or an assistant,  rather than the CIA director, delivers to the president), the president's  daily threat report, and the National Intelligence Estimates, so that more nuance  and input from all agencies are incorporated. But if the spirit of the intelligence  overhaul effort was to create a CEO for the intelligence community, not just a  new top briefer for the president, that transformation has yet to happen. As Admiral  William Studeman of the WMD commission argued, "The PDB is not a good  use of Negroponte's time. It should take less than one percent. It's an  important thing relative to an important customer but he needs to be focusing on  the rest of the community." Another senior intelligence official expressed the  problem more bluntly: "Only Negroponte needs to understand what the intelligence  business is, and it's not just about the PDB. It's about looking at  organizational issues. People at the top are trying to play nice with each other,  but nobody is willing to make tough calls on what the CIA and FBI can and  cannot do. The DNI is putting together staffs to compensate for structural deficiencies  rather than addressing the deficiencies themselves."</p>
<p>BUSINESS AS USUAL</p>
<p>The fact that an intelligence shakeup occurred  at all remains a singular accomplishment. A unique convergence of forces -- the  resounding success of the 9/11 Commission, growing media attention on intelligence  shortcomings, shifting dynamics in Congress and the White House -- allowed for  some progress despite long-entrenched opposition. But even broad support in the  Senate, overwhelming public opinion, and a best-selling report were not enough to  move Congress nearly as far as overhaul proponents had hoped. The story thus serves  as a textbook case of how the opaque ways of Washington's bureaucratic warfare  undermine sound policy. Insiders used both official and unofficial levers of power to  keep as much of their turf intact as they could. As with so many bills, a compromise  resulted.</p>
<p>Most worrying is that this compromise, already  laden with caveats, could become a standalone accomplishment rather than part of  a long-term transformation. A DNI is in place and the NCTC is up and running,  but the risk of complacency is rising. Last September, the disbanded 9/11 Commission  began issuing a series of toughly worded statements warning of the incompleteness  of the effort, but this time around the panel did not shake Congress into action.  All the while, the challenges to the U.S. intelligence agencies are growing, from  North Korea to Iran to the insurgency in Iraq. And Hurricane Katrina tragically  underscored the poor state of the nation's emergency response infrastructure.  Indeed, the rise and fall of the reform effort brings to mind Dean Acheson's  famous quip. "Washington," he noted, "is like a self-sealing tank  on a military aircraft. When a bullet passes through, it closes up." The bullet  of intelligence reform may have hit its mark, but the tank remains intact.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110374/ajax/content?token=osLP9nuaLdPU0aqhqHXIXhmVxpOM_bvX1qmW-fe_dTc" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
