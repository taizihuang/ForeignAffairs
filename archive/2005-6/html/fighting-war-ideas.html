<p>Islam and the West are not engaged in a clash  of civilizations -- at least not yet. But the West is being drawn into the clash  of two competing ideologies within the Islamic world. Proponents of the first believe  that Islam is compatible with secular democracy and basic civil liberties. Proponents  of the second are committed to replacing the current world order with a new caliphate -- that  is, a global Islamic state. They are the ones who seek to trigger a true clash of  civilizations, partly in order to force the more moderate Muslims to choose their  interpretation of Islam.</p>
<p>Extremist Islamist organizations such as al  Qaeda have become well known in recent years for trying to accomplish their objectives  through terrorism and political violence. Less well known, however, are the complementary  organizations devoted not to direct action but to ideological struggle. Of these,  the most important has been Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT, or the Party of Liberation), a transnational  movement that has served as radical Sunni Islamism's ideological vanguard.</p>
<p>HT is not itself a terrorist organization,  but it can usefully be thought of as a conveyor belt for terrorists. It indoctrinates  individuals with radical ideology, priming them for recruitment by more extreme  organizations where they can take part in actual operations. By combining fascist  rhetoric, Leninist strategy, and Western sloganeering with Wahhabi theology, HT  has made itself into a very real and potent threat that is extremely difficult for  liberal societies to counter.</p>
<p>HT's ideology and theology, which  are derived from those of other radical Islamist groups, are simplified to make  them more accessible to the masses. Whereas many other Islamist groups insist that  their particular religious interpretation is the only valid one or are obsessed  with a single issue, such as Israel or Kashmir, HT keeps its focus on the broader  goal of uniting all Muslims under the Islamist banner and thus emphasizes issues  of more general concern, such as the clash of civilizations or the injustices suffered  by Muslims worldwide. Other radical Islamists therefore tend to see the group not  as a competitor but as an ally and often use HT's concepts and literature (readily  available on the Internet) to rally their own supporters.</p>

</div>
</div><p>HT's greatest achievement to date  is that it has shifted the terms of debate within the Muslim world. Until a few  years ago, most Islamist groups considered the notion of establishing a new caliphate  a utopian goal. Now, an increasing number of people consider it a serious objective.  And after decades of stressing the existence and unity of a global Islamic community  (umma), HT can take pride in the growing feeling among Muslims that their primary  identity stems from, and their primary loyalty is owed to, their religion rather  than their race, ethnicity, or nationality.</p>
<p>HT's exact size is difficult to  confirm because the group is composed of secretive cells, but its membership is  estimated to number in the hundreds in European countries, such as Denmark, and  up to tens of thousands in Muslim countries, such as Uzbekistan. Because many governments  recognize the threat it poses to them, HT is banned in most of the Muslim world  as well as in Russia and Germany. But until recently, it has been allowed to operate  freely elsewhere, most notably in the United Kingdom, where it has played a major  role in the radicalization of disaffected Muslim youth. (There is some evidence of  an underground HT presence in the United States as well.)</p>
<p>In the wake of the bombings in London  this past July, however, British attitudes are changing, especially since the bombers  were revealed to be members of an HT splinter group. In August, British Prime Minister  Tony Blair announced a series of measures his government would take to address the  threat of Islamist extremism, including compiling lists of suspect Web sites, bookshops,  and organizations as a prelude to the possible deportation of foreign nationals  associated with them. Blair said that outlawing HT in the United Kingdom would be  part of the crackdown. But the proposed ban is being opposed by some of Blair's  advisers in the Islamic community, on the grounds that the organization is itself  nonviolent.</p>
<p>Since HT occupies a gray zone of militancy,  with its activities involving more than mere expression of opinion but less than  terrorism, regulating its activities poses a unique challenge to liberal democracies.  How Western governments and societies can meet the challenge HT poses without sacrificing  their own most cherished values in the process is not entirely clear. What is clear,  however, is that ignoring the problem is no longer an option.</p>
<p>ISLAM'S BOLSHEVIKS</p>
<p>The modern Islamist movement emerged with  the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928, four years after Atatürk, the  founder of modern Turkey, abolished the Ottoman caliphate. Inspired by the works  of the thirteenth-century thinker Ibn Taymiyya and his eighteenth-century ideological  successor Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the group's key ideologue, Sayyid Qutb,  held that the Islamic world's decline could be reversed only if a small group  of "real" Muslims emulated the ways of the Prophet Muhammad and worked  to replace the existing governments in Muslim lands with Islamic ones.</p>
<p>In 1953, deciding that the Muslim Brotherhood's  ideology was too accommodating, one of its members, a Palestinian judge named Sheikh  Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, left to form the more radical Hizb ut-Tahrir in what was then  Jordanian-ruled East Jerusalem. Drawing on the work of Qutb and other Islamists,  Nabhani rejected capitalism as exploitative and democracy as godless. He asserted  that the only way to reestablish the kind of Islamic society promulgated by the  Prophet was to liberate Muslims from the thoughts, systems, and laws of kufr (nonbelievers)  and replace the Judeo-Christian-dominated nation-state system with a borderless  umma ruled by a new caliph.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Nabhani viewed Western civilization  and Islam as mutually exclusive systems vying for ideological dominance within Muslim  societies. Both capitalism and socialism were anathema, he argued, since both failed  to recognize the primacy of Islam. Guided by its founder's beliefs, HT took  the fall of communism in stride, identifying Western democratic capitalism as the  primary remaining impediment to the establishment of a truly Islamic society. However  much HT despises the existing governments in the Muslim world, accordingly, it is  no fan of U.S. efforts at "democracy promotion," considering them to be  part of a neocolonial conspiracy and simply the latest manifestation of the West's  permanent animosity toward Islam. To HT and its followers, "the war on terrorism"  is a euphemism for "the war on Islam."</p>
<p>Nabhani died in 1977 and was succeeded  by Abd al-Qadim Zallum, a Palestinian cleric, who in 2003 was succeeded in turn  by Ata Abu Rashta, a Palestinian who had served as HT's spokesman in Jordan.  Under Rashta's leadership, HT has become more aggressive; Western intelligence  sources believe it has instructed its members to direct their activities against  U.S. allies, especially countries that supported the Iraq war. After the attacks  of September 11, 2001, for example, HT stated that the "US and Great Britain  [had] declare[d] war against Islam and Muslims" and argued that all Muslims  were "in a state of war" in which jihad against Americans and Jews would  be acceptable. (HT ideology has long been marked by a pronounced anti-Semitism,  taking certain Koranic verses out of context to mean that Muslims have a duty, in  the group's words, to "destroy the monstrous Jewish entity.")</p>
<p>HT describes itself as a political  party, even though it has never registered as such and denounces all existing political  systems. It does not seek to elect candidates to political office, focusing instead  on extraparliamentary agitation. In order to operate freely and avoid problems with  law enforcement, however, HT scrupulously refrains from engaging in criminal or  terrorist activities. Like the Bolsheviks did, HT has a utopian goal that it pursues  through ideological struggle, driven by the actions of secretive cells. For the  global revolution it envisions, HT does not need large numbers; hundreds of supporters  in critical positions are more important than thousands of foot soldiers.</p>
<p>THE PROPHET'S WAY?</p>
<p>In its effort to re-create the caliphate,  HT seeks to emulate the method adopted by the Prophet Muhammad when he established  the first Islamic state. According to the group's interpretation, the Prophet  did so by patiently disseminating ideas, then organizing followers, and only then  moving to seize power. HT thus envisions a three-step process of its own.</p>
<p>HT's focus in the first stage is on building  the party, a goal accomplished by recruitment and propaganda. Recruitment methods  vary from country to country, but HT members generally seek out young people with  existential questions and bring them into the party's circle. Prospective candidates  are formally introduced to the party apparatus by interacting with a study group;  most join to learn about Islam in general but over time are indoctrinated with HT's  particular version of Islamic political history so that they may be purged of all  "non-Islamic" thoughts. New members are required to take the HT membership  oath, which includes a commitment to "carry out even those decisions of the  party leaders that I find objectionable." By the end of their apprenticeships,  which can last from six months to three years, HT members are ideologically and  spiritually prepared to deal with any hardship that may befall them as they embark  on the struggle.</p>
<p>During the second stage of HT's  grand plan -- which the group has reached in most of the countries in which it  operates -- members form new cells and try to create tension between governments  and their peoples. Members are asked to modify their behavior so as to blend in  with the population around them and infiltrate the government.</p>
<p>When the second stage is complete,  the ground will supposedly be ripe for an Islamic revolution to establish a state  ruled by sharia. The third stage will be reached, the group believes, when the umma  embraces HT's interpretation of Islam and all the implications associated with  it. Unlike most global jihadist groups, HT believes it can carry out the political  revolution in a nonviolent manner, relying on the penetration of government institutions  and the recruitment of key officials.</p>
<p>Although it has been engaged in the  war of ideologies for over half a century, HT has made enormous progress recently  using the most modern of mediums, the Internet. Indeed, the Internet's global  reach is perfect for a group that denies the legitimacy of political borders. HT's  Web sites can be easily accessed by Muslims anywhere, and the Internet is especially  effective at facilitating communications with and among people living in repressive  societies.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>The party has essentially constructed  a virtual Islamist community in cyberspace, frequented by members, prospective members,  and sympathizers. HT's Web sites are designed to draw in Web-surfing Muslims  who feel alienated from the societies in which they live, providing them with a  place to obtain news and analysis, exchange ideas, and feel part of a global Muslim  community. Moreover, unlike in many other venues, there is no gender segregation,  allowing women to take part in political activism in cyberspace in a way they have  long been denied offline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for second-generation Muslims  living in the West, HT's Web sites offer easily accessible literature in many  languages and through this literature an alternative source of historical, political,  and theological interpretation. These Muslims often complain that their information  about Islam comes only from Western "Orientalists." HT fills this void  with its own take on religion and world events.</p>
<p>THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY</p>
<p>Today, HT is active in more than 40 countries  and has a carefully designed strategy for each. As with the communist movement before  it, HT's approach is both hierarchical and decentralized, global and local:  all of its branches are devoted to the common goal of bringing about a global revolution,  but different tactics are used in different places. In the Middle East, Central Asia,  and South Asia, HT aims to overthrow governments, since it sees particular regimes  there as direct obstacles to resurrecting the caliphate. In the West, HT's  aim is to unite Muslims on the basis of their Islamic identity and prevent their  assimilation into Western culture.</p>
<p>HT focuses its efforts on three areas: Turkey,  Central Asia, and western Europe. Turkey is in many ways the key battleground in  the war of ideologies. If the abolisher of the caliphate is accepted into the EU,  that presumed Christian club, then HT's "clash of civilizations"  paradigm will effectively be proved wrong.</p>
<p>Although HT has generally been considered  a marginal player in Turkey, active campaigning has enabled it to make serious inroads  there. Paradoxically, as Turkey is reforming its legal and constitutional systems  to boost its chances of joining the EU, it is becoming increasingly vulnerable to  domestic Islamist extremists, partly because some of the measures traditionally  used to keep radicals in check are being abolished. HT's main agenda today  is to convince the Turks that they should not try to enter the EU, arguing that  membership would cost them their Islamic identity. Instead, HT argues, Turkey should  raise the Islamic flag and become a leading opponent of the Judeo-Christian civilization.</p>
<p>The prize for HT in Central Asia is  Uzbekistan, historically a center of scientific learning and enlightened, tolerant  Islamic culture. With over 26 million inhabitants (nearly 90 percent of whom are  Muslims), the region's largest and most effective army, and a key location,  Uzbekistan has great strategic importance and influence that extends beyond its  borders.</p>
<p>The greatest gift to HT in Uzbekistan  has been the dictatorial rule of President Islam Karimov. HT is well positioned  to exploit the country's dangerous mix of corruption, poverty, drug addiction,  and repression. Furthermore, HT serves the immediate personal needs of its local  members, filling the deep psychological void at the center of many of their lives.</p>
<p>Ironically, HT has been able to advance  its agenda in the region with help from groups in the West, by framing the Central  Asian governments' reactions to its activities as efforts to suppress religion  and dissent rather than efforts to combat radical ideology. Instead of voicing concern  over the potential impact HT infiltrators could have on local governments and populations,  many Western organizations and governments have focused their criticism almost exclusively  on the tough administrative measures taken by Central Asian governments to halt  Islamist extremism.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>The third regional focus of HT is western  Europe, where the group has a strong presence in several countries with large Muslim  populations. Many European HT members are immigrants who fled politically repressive  countries in recent decades. Western Europe's difficulty absorbing and assimilating  such immigrants has left many of them without a sense of belonging or a clear identity,  which HT and its affiliates are happy to provide. HT has been particularly successful  at recruiting frustrated youth who have lost faith in the systems of the countries  to which they or their parents came. As a senior European diplomat has put it, after  joining HT, "they turn from being rebels without a cause to rebels with a cause."</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of the countries  that have banned HT were late to recognize the threat it posed. Initially, for example,  HT was tolerated in Jordan. But in 1968 and 1969, HT tried -- with the help of  the military -- to overthrow the government and was then banned. In Egypt, too,  it took a coup attempt (in 1974) for the Egyptian government to ban the group. Credible  reports indicate that HT members have also been involved in attempted government  overthrows in Syria, Tunisia, and Iraq. In short, as HT has spread across the Middle  East and the rest of the Muslim world, it has attracted the attention of governments  and been outlawed -- but only after having already created hundreds, if not thousands,  of hardened radicals in each country.</p>
<p>WHAT IS TO BE DONE?</p>
<p>HT has provided Muslims with a compelling  explanation for why the Islamic world has fallen behind the West in recent centuries.  It also offers a simple remedy: close the gap by destroying the existing order. History,  in this view, is still very much in play. As Imran Waheed, the spokesman for HT  in the United Kingdom, recently commented, "[Francis] Fukuyama says we have  reached the end of History because there's a lack of a viable alternative ideology  to capitalism and Western civilization. We view our work as a direct challenge to  that statement: we have to prove him wrong."</p>
<p>The United States (and the West more generally)  was able to prevail in the last epic ideological struggle, the Cold War, only after  coming up with a durable strategy based on thorough study of communist ideology  and tactics. That strategy was to contain the enemy's military threat while  offering a better ideological alternative, one based on political and personal freedom  combined with economic prosperity.</p>
<p>It is imperative to recognize that  another such struggle is unfolding and that it requires a comparably durable strategy.  Today, however, the target population is well aware of the basic Western alternative  and is largely rejecting it. More and more Muslims -- and not just terrorists -- believe  that they will always be looked down on in a U.S.-led world order. They believe  George W. Bush's "freedom and democracy agenda" is merely a trick  to placate them so that the United States can maintain its global hegemony. Instead  of acquiescing, HT argues, Muslims need to unite and rise up so as to return to  their former glory. The international political structure of the Cold War has thus  been turned on its head: just as the United States did for dissidents behind the  Iron Curtain, so today HT and its brethren raise hope among disaffected Muslims of  a dignified alternative to their perceived oppression.</p>
<p>The first task in countering this challenge  is to deprive HT of the ability to discredit the United States and its ideals. In  the wake of the war in Iraq and the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo  Bay, however, the credibility and moral authority of the United States in the Muslim  world is at an all-time low, and so this will not be easy. In fact, rehabilitating  America's image will probably take decades and require an ideological campaign  highlighting values common to the Western and Muslim worlds.</p>
<p>President Bush's "forward  strategy of freedom" will never be received as well as an approach stressing  justice and dignity, concepts that resonate much more strongly in Muslim societies.  Washington also needs to minimize the general causes of grievance that anti-American  radicals are able to exploit, such as the arrogance with which the United States  wields its power and its perceived biases in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict.</p>
<p>Although perhaps familiar, these policy  prescriptions are nonetheless important. The second task -- finding ways to suppress  the activities of HT and comparable militant organizations without sacrificing too  many civil liberties -- is more novel and perhaps more difficult. Taking advantage  of the West's own freedoms of speech, assembly, and the like, HT has spread  hate-filled, anti-Semitic, and anticonstitutional ideas and created a fifth column  of activists working to undermine the very systems under which they live. Western  governments and societies must find ways to protect themselves not just from terrorism  but also from the indirect incitement that is HT's specialty.</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--6">
<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--6');
            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>The glorification and encouragement  of suicide bombers, the dissemination of justifications for violence, and the development  of support networks for militant activities create a crucial, if barely visible,  ideological infrastructure that enables the more explosive actions of Islamist radicals  that actually make the headlines. This infrastructure needs to be dismantled for  Western societies to be fully secured. But how to do it? Blocking the dissemination  of extremist literature over the Internet is technically difficult. As soon as one  Web site is blocked, another one pops up; many Web addresses are difficult to locate,  and tracking them requires close cooperation among intelligence services in multiple  countries. The political difficulties are even greater, since many Europeans and Americans  do not understand the ideological threat radical Islam poses and therefore see no  need to curb civil rights to fight it.</p>
<p>Political leaders thus need to explain  that although fears of a repeat of McCarthyism are legitimate and restrictions on  civil rights need to be policed carefully, a failure to take sensible precautions  now is likely to lead to greater troubles later. If the West does not stop the spread  of radicalism, down the road its societies will become further polarized as tensions  increase and more ripe for dramatic overreactions after further attacks occur.</p>
<p>These problems are coming to a head  in the United Kingdom, where the Blair government has stated its intention to pass  legislation outlawing HT and its offshoot, al-Muhajiroun, and banning indirect incitement  to violence by extremist clerics who glorify acts of terrorism. Blair's goals  are to combat terrorism and its militant supporters; to accomplish them, he is apparently  prepared to amend human rights laws to make it easier to deport foreign nationals  suspected of links with terrorism. Although these measures may seem draconian, they  are both necessary and long overdue. Given the opposition such proposals have already  generated in certain quarters, however, it remains to be seen what restrictions  the British government will adopt in the end and which other countries will emulate  the United Kingdom's actions.</p>
<p>Although other European nations, such  as Denmark and the Netherlands, have discussed banning HT, only Germany actually  has (in 2003), and it did so by applying its unique laws on anti-Semitism. The German  government did not target HT for being an organization directly engaged in terrorist  activity; it banned the group in order to wipe out the breeding grounds for Islamist  terrorism. It certainly strengthened the German government's case that Shaker  Assem, an HT leader in Germany, had lectured the study group of Mohammed Atta and  that Atta and several other September 11 planners were known to have read HT's  German magazine, Explizit.</p>
<p>The third task is to find ways of helping  moderates win the theological and ideological civil war currently taking place within  the Muslim world. One way to start would be for Western journalists and human rights  organizations to expose HT's self-created image as a "peaceful" organization  as the fraud it is. The West can also help by encouraging governments in Muslim  countries to allow truly peaceful religious organizations to promote tolerance and  interfaith dialogue. It can assist them in developing school curricula that emphasize  critical thinking, patriotism, ethics, and those Islamic values that are compatible  with democracy and secularism.</p>
<p>In this context, the EU's handling  of Turkey's candidacy for membership will be an important test of Western policy.  If the Turkish Muslim tradition that emphasizes a convergence of civilizations is  accepted by the EU, then HT's arguments about an inevitable clash of civilizations  will lose ground. The rejection of full Turkish membership, however, would bear  out HT's broader vision of a divided world.</p>
<p>None of these tasks is easy and none  can be accomplished quickly. The alternative to undertaking them, however, is leaving  the cancer to spread. Ideological struggles can take even longer to wage than overt  military ones, and even then success is often less decisive or lasting. The central  ingredients in any strategy must therefore be patience and determination. On the  fourth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, some noted with disapproval that  a comparable length of time after Pearl Harbor, the Axis had already been defeated.  They might more appropriately have considered that the Cold War lasted for almost  half a century.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110372/ajax/content?token=djzqyOGwyIO9VQuw2iT181UZFyxJXtjIJQArE5G1v3Y" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
