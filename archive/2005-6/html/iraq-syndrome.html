<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>THE WAR AND THE PUBLIC</p>
<p>American troops have been sent into harm's way  many times since 1945, but in only three cases -- Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq -- have  they been drawn into sustained ground combat and suffered more than 300 deaths in  action. American public opinion became a key factor in all three wars, and in each  one there has been a simple association: as casualties mount, support decreases.  Broad enthusiasm at the outset invariably erodes.</p>
<p>The only thing remarkable about the current  war in Iraq is how precipitously American public support has dropped off. Casualty  for casualty, support has declined far more quickly than it did during either the  Korean War or the Vietnam War. And if history is any indication, there is little  the Bush administration can do to reverse this decline.</p>
<p>More important, the impact of deteriorating  support will not end when the war does. In the wake of the wars in Korea and Vietnam,  the American public developed a strong aversion to embarking on such ventures again.  A similar sentiment -- an "Iraq syndrome" -- seems to be developing now, and it  will have important consequences for U.S. foreign policy for years after the last  American battalion leaves Iraqi soil.</p>
<p>DROWNING BY NUMBERS</p>

</div><p>The public gave substantial support to the  military ventures in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq as the troops were sent in. In all  cases, support decreased as casualties -- whether of draftees, volunteers, or reservists -- mounted.  In each case, the increase in the number of people who considered the venture to  be a mistake was steep during the war's early stages, as reluctant supporters were  rather quickly alienated; the erosion slowed as approval was reduced to the harder  core. (The dramatic early drop in support for the war in Korea reflected the large  number of casualties suffered in the opening phase of that war.)</p>
<p>The most striking thing about the comparison  among the three wars is how much more quickly support has eroded in the case of  Iraq. By early 2005, when combat deaths were around 1,500, the percentage of respondents  who considered the Iraq war a mistake -- over half -- was about the same as the  percentage who considered the war in Vietnam a mistake at the time of the 1968 Tet  offensive, when nearly 20,000 soldiers had already died.</p>
<p>This lower tolerance for casualties  is largely due to the fact that the American public places far less value on the  stakes in Iraq than it did on those in Korea and Vietnam. The main threats Iraq  was thought to present to the United States when troops went in -- weapons of mass  destruction and support for international terrorism -- have been, to say the least,  discounted. With those justifications gone, the Iraq war is left as something of  a humanitarian venture, and, as Francis Fukuyama has put it, a request to spend  "several hundred billion dollars and several thousand American lives in order to  bring democracy to ... Iraq" would "have been laughed out of court." Given the evaporation  of the main reasons for going to war and the unexpectedly high level of American  casualties, support for the war in Iraq is, if anything, higher than one might expect -- a  reflection of the fact that many people still connect the effort there to the "war"  on terrorism, an enterprise that continues to enjoy huge support. In addition, the  toppling of Saddam Hussein remains a singular accomplishment -- something the American  people had wanted since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</p>
<p>When one shifts from questions about  whether the war was a "mistake" or "worth it" to ones about whether the United States  should get out, much the same pattern holds for Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq: relatively  steep declines in support for continuing the war in the early stages, slower erosion  later. However, it is close to impossible to judge how many people want to get out  or stay the course at any given time because so much depends on how the question  is worded. For example, there is far more support for "gradual withdrawal" or "beginning  to withdraw" than for "withdrawing" or "immediate withdrawal." Thus in August 2005,  The Washington Post found that 54 percent of respondents favored staying and 44  percent favored withdrawing when the options were posed this way: "Do you think  the United States should keep its military forces in Iraq until civil order is restored  there, even if that means continued U.S. military casualties, or, do you think the  United States should withdraw its military forces from Iraq in order to avoid further  U.S. military casualties, even if that means civil order is not restored there?"  But in the same month, a Harris poll tallied only 36 percent in support of staying  and 61 percent in support of withdrawing when it asked, "Do you favor keeping a  large number of U.S. troops in Iraq until there is a stable government there or  bringing most of our troops home in the next year?" Still, no matter how the questions  are phrased, all the polls have logged increases in pro-withdrawal sentiment over  the course of the war.</p>
<p>Many analysts have tried to link declining  support to factors other than accumulating combat deaths. For example, the notion  that public opinion sours as casualties increase has somehow turned into "support  drops when they start seeing the body bags" -- a vivid expression that some in the  Bush administration have apparently taken literally. As a result, the military has  worked enterprisingly to keep Americans from seeing pictures of body bags or flag-draped  coffins in the hope that this will somehow arrest the decline in enthusiasm for the  war effort. But such pictures are not necessary to drive home the basic reality of  mounting casualties.</p>
<p>Growing opposition to the war effort  also has little to do with whether or not there is an active antiwar movement at  home. There has not been much of one in the case of the Iraq war, nor was there  one during the war in Korea. Nonetheless, support for those ventures eroded as it  did during the Vietnam War, when antiwar protest was frequent and visible. In fact,  since the Vietnam protest movement became so strongly associated with anti-American  values and activities, it may ultimately have been somewhat counterproductive.</p>
<p>Moreover, support for the war declines  whether or not war opponents are able to come up with specific policy alternatives.  Dwight Eisenhower never seemed to have much of a plan for getting out of the Korean  War -- although he did say that, if elected, he would visit the place -- but discontent  with the war still worked well for him in the 1952 election; Richard Nixon's proposals  for fixing the Vietnam mess were distinctly unspecific, although he did from time  to time mutter that he had a "secret plan." Wars hurt the war-initiating political  party not because the opposition comes up with a coherent clashing vision -- George  McGovern tried that, with little success, against Nixon in 1972 -- but because discontent  over the war translates into vague distrust of the capacities of the people running  the country.</p>

</div><p>The impact of war discontent on congressional  races is less clear. Democrats attempted to capitalize on the widespread outrage  over Nixon's invasion of Cambodia in 1970 but were unable to change things much.  And subsequent developments, including campaign reform legislation, have made incumbents  increasingly less vulnerable.</p>
<p>DAMAGE CONTROL</p>
<p>President George W. Bush, like Lyndon Johnson  before him, has made countless speeches explaining what the effort in Iraq is about,  urging patience, and asserting that progress is being made. But as was also evident  during Woodrow Wilson's campaign to sell the League of Nations to the American public,  the efficacy of the bully pulpit is much overrated. The prospects for reversing the  erosion of support for the war in Iraq are thus limited. The run-ups to the two  wars in Iraq are also instructive in this regard: even though both Presidents Bush  labored mightily to sell the war effort, the only thing that succeeded in raising  the level of enthusiasm was the sight of troops actually heading into action, which  triggered a predictable "rally round the flag" effect.</p>
<p>Although the impact of official rhetoric is  limited, favorable occurrences in the war itself can boost support from time to  time. In the case of the war in Iraq, for example, there were notable upward shifts  in many polls after Saddam was captured and elections were held. These increases,  however, proved to be temporary, more bumps on the road than permanent changes in  direction. Support soon fell back to where it had been before and then continued  its generally downward course. The same is true of negative occurrences: a drop  in support after the disclosure of abuses at Abu Ghraib in 2004 was in time mostly  reversed.</p>
<p>Some scholars have argued that support  for war is determined by the prospects for success rather than casualties. Americans  are "defeat-phobic" rather than "casualty-phobic," the argument goes; they do not  really care how many casualties are suffered so long as their side comes out the  winner. For example, the political scientists Peter Feaver and Christopher Gelpi  have calculated, rather remarkably, that Americans would on average be entirely  willing to see 6,861 soldiers die in order to bring democracy to Congo.</p>
<p>There never were periods of continuous  good news in the wars in Korea or Vietnam, so there is no clear precedent here.  But should good news start coming in from Iraq -- including, in particular, a decline  in American casualty rates -- it would more likely cause the erosion in public support  to slow or even cease rather than trigger a large upsurge in support. For support  to rise notably, many of those now disaffected by the war would need to reverse their  position, and that seems rather unlikely: polls that seek to tap intensity of feeling  find that more than 80 percent of those opposed to the war "strongly" feel that  way. If you purchase a car for twice what it is worth, you will still consider the  deal to have been a mistake even if you come to like the car.</p>
<p>Also relevant is the fact that despite  the comparatively mild-mannered behavior of Democratic leaders in the run-up to  the Iraq war, partisan differences regarding this war, and this president, are incredibly  deep. Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at the University of California, San  Diego, has documented that the partisan divide over the war in Iraq is considerably  greater than for any military action over the last half century and that the partisan  split on presidential approval ratings, despite a major narrowing after the attacks  of September 11, 2001, is greater than for any president over that period -- greater  than for Clinton, Reagan, or Nixon. This means that Bush cannot look for increased  Republican support because he already has practically all of it; meanwhile, Democrats  are unlikely to budge much. There may be some hope for him among independents, but  their war-support patterns more nearly track those of the almost completely disaffected  Democrats than those of the steadfast Republicans.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is difficult to see what  a spate of good news would look like at this point. A clear-cut victory, like the  one scored by George H.W. Bush in the Gulf in 1991, is hugely unlikely -- and the  glow even of that one faded quickly as Saddam continued to hold forth in Iraq. From  the start of the current Iraq war, the invading forces were too small to establish  order, and some of the early administrative policies proved fatally misguided. In  effect, the United States created an instant failed state, and clambering out of  that condition would be difficult in the best of circumstances. If the worst violence  diminishes, and Iraq thereby ceases to be quite so much of a bloody mess, the war  will attract less attention. But there is still likely to be plenty of official and  unofficial corruption, sporadic vigilantism, police misconduct, militia feuding, political  backstabbing, economic travail, regional separatism, government incompetence, rampant  criminality, religious conflict, and posturing by political entrepreneurs spouting  anti-American and anti-Israeli rhetoric. Under such conditions, the American venture  in Iraq is unlikely to be seen as a great victory by those now in opposition, over  half of whom profess to be not merely dissatisfied with the war, but angry over  it.</p>
<p>In all of this, what chiefly matters  for American public opinion is American losses, not those of the people defended.  By some estimates, the number of Iraqis who have died as a result of the invasion  has reached six figures -- vastly more than have been killed by all international  terrorists in all of history. Sanctions on Iraq probably were a necessary cause  of death for an even greater number of Iraqis, most of them children. Yet the only  cumulative body count that truly matters in the realm of American public opinion,  and the only one that is routinely reported, is the American one. There is nothing  new about this: although there was considerable support for the wars in Korea and  Vietnam, polls made clear that people backed the wars because they saw them as vital  to confronting the communist threat; defending the South Koreans or the South Vietnamese  per se was never thought of as an important goal.</p>

</div><p>THE POLITICS OF DEBACLE</p>
<p>In Iraq, as they did in Vietnam, U.S. troops  face an armed opposition that is dedicated, resourceful, capable of replenishing  its ranks, and seemingly determined to fight as long as necessary. In Vietnam, the  hope was that after suffering enough punishment, the enemy would reach its "breaking  point" and then either fade away or seek accommodation. Great punishment was inflicted,  but the enemy never broke; instead, it was the United States that faded away after  signing a face-saving agreement. Whether the insurgents in Iraq have the same determination  and fortitude is yet to be seen. The signs thus far, however, are not very encouraging:  the insurgency does not appear to be weakening.</p>
<p>Many people, including President Bush, argue  that the United States must slog on because a precipitous exit from Iraq would energize  Islamist militants, who would see it as an even greater victory than the expulsion  of the Soviet Union from Afghanistan. A quick exit would confirm, the thinking goes,  Osama bin Laden's basic theory: that terrorists can defeat the United States by  continuously inflicting on it casualties that are small in number but still draining.  A venture designed and sold as a blow against international terrorists would end  up emboldening and energizing them.</p>
<p>The problem is that almost any exit  from Iraq will have this effect. Bin Laden, as well as huge majorities in Muslim  countries and in parts of Europe, believe that the United States invaded Iraq as  part of its plan to control oil supplies in the Middle East. Although Washington  has no intention of doing that, at least not in the direct sense that bin Laden  and others mean, U.S. forces will inevitably leave Iraq without having accomplished  what many consider to be Washington's real goals there -- and the terrorist insurgents  will claim credit for forcing the United States out before it fulfilled these key  objectives. Iraq has also, of course, become something of a terrorist training -- and  inspiration -- zone.</p>
<p>When the United States was preparing  to withdraw from Vietnam, many Americans feared that there would be a bloodbath  if the country fell to the North Vietnamese. And indeed, on taking control, the  Communists executed tens of thousands of people, sent hundreds of thousands to "reeducation  camps" for long periods, and so mismanaged the economy that hundreds of thousands  fled the country out of desperation, often in barely floating boats. (What happened  in neighboring Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge took over makes even the word "bloodbath"  seem an understatement.)</p>
<p>There is a similar concern this time  around: Iraq could devolve into a civil war after the Americans leave. Thus, U.S.  officials have updated "Vietnamization" and applied it to Iraq. They are making strenuous  efforts to fabricate a reasonably viable local government, police, and military that  can take over the fight, allowing U.S. forces to withdraw judiciously. In Vietnam,  of course, communist forces took over less than two years after the United States  installed a sympathetic government. Although the consequences of a U.S. withdrawal  from Iraq are likely to be messy, they may be less dire. The insurgency in Iraq,  albeit deadly and dedicated, represents a much smaller, less popular, and less organized  force than the Vietcong did, and it does not have the same kind of international  backing. Moreover, many of the insurgents are fighting simply to get U.S. troops  out of the country and can be expected to stop when the Americans leave. The insurgency  will likely become more manageable without the U.S. presence, even if there is a  determined effort by at least some of the rebels to go after a government that, in  their eyes, consists of quislings and collaborators. It is also impressive that  efforts by the insurgents to stoke a civil war between the Shiites and the Sunnis  have not been very successful thus far; most Shiites have refused to see the insurgents  as truly representative of the Sunni population.</p>
<p>Even if Iraq does turn out to be a  foreign policy debacle -- by declining into a hopeless quagmire or collapsing into  civil chaos -- history suggests that withdrawing need not be politically devastating  (unless, perhaps, failure in Iraq leads directly to terrorism in the United States).  As it happens, the American people have proved quite capable of taking debacle in  stride; they do not seem to be terribly "defeat-phobic." They supported the decision  to withdraw U.S. troops from Lebanon in 1984 after a terrorist bomb killed 241 Americans  in the civil war there; the man who presided over that debacle, Ronald Reagan, readily  won reelection a few months later. Something similar happened to Bill Clinton when  he withdrew troops from Somalia in 1994: by the time the next election rolled around,  people had largely forgotten the whole episode.</p>
<p>The most remarkable, and relevant,  precedent is the utter collapse of the U.S. position in Vietnam in 1975. The man  who presided over that debacle, Gerald Ford, actually tried to use it to his advantage  in his reelection campaign the next year. As he pointed out, when he came into office  the United States was "still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam, [but now]  we are at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign  soil tonight." His challenger, Jimmy Carter, apparently did not think it good politics  to point out the essential absurdity of Ford's declaration.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if disaster follows  a U.S. withdrawal -- as it did in Vietnam, Lebanon, and Somalia -- the people dying  will be Iraqis, not Americans. And the deaths of foreigners, as noted earlier, are  not what move the public.</p>

</div><p>INDISPENSABLE NATION?</p>
<p>After the war in Vietnam, there was a strong  desire among Americans never to do "that" again. And, in fact, there never was "another  Vietnam" during the Cold War. Due to this "Vietnam syndrome," Congress hampered  the White House's ability to pursue even rather modest anticommunist ventures in  Africa and, to a lesser extent, Latin America (though there was bipartisan support  for aiding the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan). Meanwhile, the genocide in Cambodia  was studiously ignored in part because of fears that paying attention might lead  to the conclusion that American troops should be sent over to rectify the disaster;  over most of the course of the genocide, the three major networks devoted a total  of 29 minutes of their newscasts to a cataclysm in which millions died.</p>
<p>No matter how the war in Iraq turns out, an  Iraq syndrome seems likely. A poll in relatively war-approving Alabama earlier this  year, for example, asked whether the United States should be prepared to send troops  back to Iraq to establish order there in the event a full-scale civil war erupted  after a U.S. withdrawal. Only a third of the respondents favored doing so.</p>
<p>Among the casualties of the Iraq syndrome  could be the Bush doctrine, unilateralism, preemption, preventive war, and indispensable-nationhood.  Indeed, these once-fashionable (and sometimes self-infatuated) concepts are already  picking up a patina of quaintness. Specifically, there will likely be growing skepticism  about various key notions: that the United States should take unilateral military  action to correct situations or overthrow regimes it considers reprehensible but  that present no immediate threat to it, that it can and should forcibly bring democracy  to other nations not now so blessed, that it has the duty to rid the world of evil,  that having by far the largest defense budget in the world is necessary and broadly  beneficial, that international cooperation is of only very limited value, and that  Europeans and other well-meaning foreigners are naive and decadent wimps. The United  States may also become more inclined to seek international cooperation, sometimes  even showing signs of humility.</p>
<p>In part because of the military and  financial overextension in Iraq (and Afghanistan), the likelihood of any coherent  application of military power or even of a focused military threat against the remaining  entities on the Bush administration's once-extensive hit list has substantially  diminished. In the meantime, any country that suspects it may be on the list has  the strongest incentive to make the American experience in Iraq as miserable as  possible. Some may also come to consider that deterring the world's last remaining  superpower can be accomplished by preemptively and prominently recruiting and training  a few thousand of their citizens to fight and die in dedicated irregular warfare  against foreign occupiers.</p>
<p>Evidence of the Iraq syndrome is emerging.  Already, Bush has toned down his language. When North Korea abruptly declared in  February that it actually possessed nuclear weapons, the announcement was officially  characterized as "unfortunate" and as "rhetoric we've heard before." Iran has already  become defiant, and its newly elected president has actually had the temerity to  suggest -- surely the unkindest cut -- that he does not consider the United States  to be the least bit indispensable. Ultimately, the chief beneficiaries of the war  in Iraq may be Iraq's fellow members of the "axis of evil."</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110370/ajax/content?token=1wlgUO2MS4Yl0qdGaOdGAbFEQ6l502-oX88bB-YgEsk" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
