<p>Tamar Jacoby's article on immigration reform ("Immigration Nation,"  November/December 2006) rightly argues that immigration is good for the United States.  A mountain of evidence has affirmed that immigration benefits the United States' economy  and the living standards of most of its people. But Jacoby is wrong when she writes  that the United States suffers from a "shortfall of unskilled labor" amounting to  "hundreds of thousands of workers a year." She writes, for example, that even if  the labor supply from Mexico dried up, "the United States would still lack unskilled  laborers and would have to find them elsewhere" and urges that the current visa  limit for year-round unskilled workers be expanded to "something closer to the 400,000-500,000  needed to keep the economy growing."</p>
<p>But the United States does not lack unskilled laborers. U.S. census  data report that 72 percent of black high school dropouts were without jobs in 2004,  up from about 66 percent in 2000. The link between immigration and high unemployment  among young black men is now well established. For almost all other groups, the  impact of immigration on jobs and the overall economy is either beneficial or  a  wash. But as research at Columbia, Georgetown, Harvard, Princeton, and the University  of California has shown, recent immigrants with low skills, little education, and  little or no English-language capacity worsen the job prospects of young black men  who also have little schooling and few skills. Until recently, the question of how  bad that impact is was treated with kid gloves. The Harvard economist George Borjas  says that "low-skill ... illegal immigration has the biggest negative impact  on the wages of low-skill workers."</p>
<p>It is not immigration, legal or illegal, that is the single cause  of all this unemployment among young black men. Their refusal to take certain kinds  of jobs and preconceptions among potential employers about bad work habits and work  attitudes are also involved. And the issue is not race alone, as excellent work  by Mary Waters at Harvard has shown. New and young black male (and, a generation  ago, black female) immigrants from the West Indies have fared better in the United  States' low-skill job market. That has also been the recent experience of young  black men from West Africa, notably Cameroon.</p>
<p>None of this argues against the genuine, and annually recurring,  labor needs of the United States' western and southwestern farms and ranches. That  work clearly depends on transient labor, and residents of the United States' urban  areas are not going to fill that need. But all those other jobs Jacoby identified,  especially those in construction that require targeted skills and training, could  be filled by young black men who today are jobless. That would require an extreme  makeover, affecting not only training and credentials but also work habits and attitudes.  The Jobs Corps is one vehicle for bringing about change, as is a major effort to  reach out to kids before they start believing that the doors to good jobs will mostly  be shut.</p>
