</p>
<p>Laurie Garrett makes it painfully clear how shortsighted and dysfunctional  our response to the global health crisis has been to date.
</p>
<p>Garrett correctly points out that it will take more than money  to make an impact on global public health, and she correctly states that unless  we start tackling public health in general instead of narrow, disease-specific problems,  we may end up worse off. But while her diagnosis is on target, her prescription  misses the mark, because she misses the most basic factors underlying not only successful  health infrastructures but also successful prevention programs and a successful  health industry: good governance and a respect for human rights.
</p>
<p>In a 2004 article in the British Medical Journal, Alvaro Franco  and his colleagues plotted life expectancy and maternal and infant mortality in  170 countries against the "freedom index" -- a measure of political rights and civil  liberties produced by Freedom House. The authors found a significant relationship  between high freedom ratings and good health indicators, even controlling for wealth  and the size of the public sector. A 2006 study by Daniel Reidpath and Pascale Allotey  examined 176 countries using World Bank data and found similar results. It is reasonable  to conclude that individuals are healthier and live longer where governments respect  human rights.
</p>
<p>Garrett's call to step back from disease-specific programs to  focus on health infrastructure, and the industrial infrastructure that supports  it, will bear no better results than the system she currently laments unless there  is a simultaneous attempt to strengthen civil-society institutions and foster greater  respect for the rights of individuals. Good governance and the protection of human  rights help to ensure accountability, transparency, and participation -- and hence  productive investment in health. Anticorruption efforts encourage industry formation,  and free societies tend to keep highly trained -- and desperately needed -- health  professionals from emigrating.
