</p>
<p>I have been following with great interest Foreign Affairs' discussion  about Laurie Garrett's article on global health. But I am struck by the irony that  a distinguished journal of foreign relations has completely missed such an important  point: today's global health lacuna is political. We simply do not have people who  are knowledgeable and experienced enough in foreign policy engaging in the politics  of global health.
</p>
<p>Most global health problems today are messy and do not remain  strictly within the realm of health. The permission to manufacture cheap generic  HIV/AIDS drugs, for example, is negotiated at the World Trade Organization  long before those same drugs are made available to the World Health Organization.  Some global health security decisions -- such as whether to fix Iraq's water mains  first or its oil pipelines -- are made at the Pentagon. Some investments in maternal  and child health in the world's poorest countries -- investments every public health  professional knows will save hundreds of thousands of lives -- are nixed on the  floor of Congress. In all these examples, public health and international affairs  intersect.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the United States, international affairs and  public health are taught separately at graduate schools. Schools of public health  are not appointing faculty with expertise in international affairs. In fact, international  politics in general is treated as a kind of no-go zone within most international  public health curricula. Health should not be political, the rationale goes. Schools  of international affairs are not any better, rarely including much health in their  curricula or appointing health faculty knowledgeable about public health.
</p>
<p>Even when public health curricula attempt to take on politics,  the focus tends to be on U.S. domestic health policy, not foreign policy, where  health is one of many competing concerns instead of the featured and privileged  one. Public health folks too often take the naive position that the value of healthy  populations -- both to individual societies and to the global community -- is self-evident  and that they should not really have to work too hard to compete with other agendas.  What is missing in global health today is a cohort of people who do not give up  on the politics of global health but rather embrace it. We need people comfortable  in the halls of power, maneuvering leaders in the service of global health. At a  time when many of the most complex global health problems are mired in political  quicksand, global public health is hindered by an expectation that health should  not be political.

</div><p>At a conference dinner in a European capital several years ago,  I was seated next to a senior international lawyer. Cordial small talk brought us  around to his expertise in international law and mine in global health. He became  animated when I spoke of the global political economy of pharmaceuticals and interrupted  to explain that he had been hired by one of the world's top-grossing pharmaceutical  companies to sue India for supporting firms producing generic antiretrovirals for  export. After about ten minutes of spinning out an elaborate plan about applying  U.S. antitrust law to challenge India on the grounds of intellectual property rights  violations (a plan that eventually succeeded), he asked my opinion on his chances  for success. I said, "In the circles I work, the emphasis is on the millions of  people dying, not on protecting the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical  companies." He turned to face me and, although I was braced for sarcasm, he said  in all earnestness, "You know, for as long as I've been working on this, no one  has ever said that to me before."
</p>
<p>That conversation is a metaphor for the very real dangers of compartmentalizing  global health education. How could a man in his position not have come in contact  with someone who would point out to him the human and health dimensions of his litigation.  But he had not and does not spend time with public health experts, and short of  those of us who care about global health trying to make inroads into his world,  it will remain that way.
