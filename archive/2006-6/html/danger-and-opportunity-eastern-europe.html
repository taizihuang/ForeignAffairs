<p>Eastern Europe is undergoing important changes that could erode Europe's  security and damage U.S. interests. The enlargement of both NATO and the European Union was supposed  to consolidate political and economic reform in the region and aid its integration with the West.  The recent rise of nationalist and populist forces in several countries in eastern Europe, however,  threatens to undermine the reform process. Enlargement fatigue in the EU and growing calls for  protectionism within western Europe could further hinder continued efforts to create a single  European market and fully integrate the new EU members.</p>
<p>At the same time, the balance of power is shifting on eastern Europe's  outer periphery. The collapse of the "Orange coalition" (the group of political leaders who led  the 2004 Orange Revolution) in Ukraine has brought to power a government much less open to reform  or eager for close ties to the West. This is likely not only to slow Ukraine's integration into Euro-Atlantic  institutions but also to have a dampening effect on reform within the other former Soviet states.  In addition, after a decade of weakness and passivity, Russia has reemerged as an important regional  and international actor, especially in the energy field.</p>
<p>These changes have gone largely unnoticed by policymakers in Washington  despite the important implications they have for U.S. interests. The United States has invested  considerable energy and resources over the last several decades promoting a Europe whole and free  that could act as a strong, cohesive partner and help the United States manage security threats  emanating from beyond Europe's borders. If eastern Europe reverts to old patterns of nationalism  and parochialism and the process of European integration falters, much of this investment will  have been squandered.</p>
<p>REFORM FATIGUE</p>

</div><p>In general, the last decade was a period of economic growth and increasing  prosperity in eastern Europe. But the tide of liberal economic reform has recently turned. Pro-Europe  and pro-market parties have lost ground throughout the region and have been replaced in several  countries by coalitions championing nationalism and populism.</p>
<p>Poland provides the most striking example of this trend, which began  there with the victory of the conservative party Law and Justice (known by its Polish acronym, PiS),  headed by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in the September 2005 parliamentary elections. The PiS consolidated  its electoral success by winning the presidential election a few weeks later, when Lech Kaczynski,  Jaroslaw's twin brother, unexpectedly triumphed over Donald Tusk of the pro-market-reform and  pro-Europe Civic Platform. The Kaczynski brothers are suspicious of free-market reforms and  favor a strong role for the state in the national economy and in other areas such as education and  the media. In foreign policy, the PiS seeks to enhance "Polish national interests," which has led  to conflicts with the EU and some of Poland's neighbors, particularly Germany. Domestically,  the PiS' positions on many social issues, such as gay rights, are at odds with the positions of many  western European states and are a source of further tension. This rightward drift in Polish politics  has been accentuated by the entry into the ruling coalition of two fringe parties, the populist  Self-Defense Party -- which draws its main support from farmers -- and the nationalist and Catholic  League of Polish Families. Both parties oppose free-market reforms and have been critical of Poland's  membership in the EU.</p>
<p>Forces hostile to economic liberalization have also gained power in  Slovakia: in June 2006, the political party Smer-Social Democracy, headed by the populist Robert  Fico, won a decisive victory over Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda's Slovak Democratic and Christian  Union in parliamentary elections. Despite Dzurinda's impressive record of economic and social  reform, Slovak voters turned their backs on him in favor of Fico and a coalition that includes two  right-wing parties hostile to market reforms.</p>
<p>The surprise victory of Rolandas Paksas over the incumbent Valdas Adamkus  in the Lithuanian presidential election of December 2002 provides another example of the rise  of populism in the region. The election took place only a few weeks after Lithuania was invited to  join NATO and the EU. Given his key role in achieving these long-standing national goals, Adamkus  was expected to win easily. Paksas, however, ran a skillful campaign that focused on Lithuania's  social and economic problems and appealed to many of the losers in the country's transformation.  (Paksas was later impeached, but that he won at all is noteworthy.)</p>
<p>At first glance, the victories of the nationalists and the populists  appear paradoxical, given the economic growth and prosperity much of eastern Europe has enjoyed  recently. But the region has also experienced a corresponding increase in inequality and unemployment.  Prosperity has been confined largely to the major cities, whereas small towns and rural areas have  suffered under the reforms. It is in these areas that people have voted for the nationalists and  the populists, who have promised less reform and more social justice. Poland's PiS, for example,  draws its support from the country's rural east and its "rust belt" -- areas that have been hard hit  by postcommunist economic measures -- whereas the more progressive Civic Platform receives its  support from Warsaw and the more prosperous north and west. Right-wing parties have also benefited  from a popular backlash against corruption. Many of the incumbents in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,  Poland, and Slovakia had been tarnished by scandals, and those incidents featured prominently  in the campaigns.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe is also undergoing an important generational transition  in leadership that could have far-reaching implications for the region's political future. In  the Czech Republic, the departure of former President Václav Havel, who embodied the moral  conscience of Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, has had a particularly acute effect. Havel's  successor, Václav Klaus, is a Euroskeptic who lacks Havel's international stature. In  Poland, many of the key figures of the Solidarity movement, who spearheaded the overthrow of communism,  have also retired or been marginalized. Most notably, Lech Walesa, the movement's leader and Poland's  first president, has retreated to splendid isolation in Gdańsk. A similar process is also evident  in the Baltic states. The death of Estonia's Lennart Meri, the grand old man of Estonian politics  and the nation's first postcommunist president, has left a political vacuum. In Lithuania, President  Adamkus, who was reelected after Paksas was impeached in 2004 and who guided the country's entry  into NATO and the EU, still commands respect, but he is 80 years old and near the end of his career.</p>
<p>These eastern European leaders can be compared to the first generation  of statesmen who rebuilt Western Europe after World War II: Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi, Charles de Gaulle, and Jean Monnet. In a similar fashion, Havel, Walesa, and others laid the political  foundations for eastern Europe's postcommunist course. Many were dissidents who had suffered  under communism and who had a strong dedication to individual freedom and Western values. They  also were committed Atlanticists who believed in the importance of maintaining strong ties to  the United States. But this generation is now retreating from the political scene. And in its place  is emerging a crop of leaders for whom the communist period is a distant memory and the United States  less of a beacon and an inspiration. As memories of the communist period fade, the strong commitment  to Atlanticism exhibited by the first generation of eastern European leaders is likely to wane.</p>

</div><p>NEW NATO, NEW CHALLENGES</p>
<p>Joining NATO was a key security objective for all of the eastern European  countries, which saw membership in the organization as protection against a resurgent Russia.  The NATO that these countries have joined, however, differs significantly from the one that existed  during the Cold War. The old NATO was primarily configured to deter a Soviet attack against its members;  the new NATO is focused on countering threats such as terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, rogue  states, and other dangers that emanate from beyond Europe's borders. NATO's transformation poses  several important challenges for its newest members. They have had to carry out two military revolutions  in less than a decade. The first was to adapt the obsolete, tank-heavy forces they inherited from  the Warsaw Pact to NATO standards at a time when their economies were weak and undergoing extreme  change. No sooner had they begun to make these highly disruptive -- and expensive -- changes than  they were faced with the more demanding challenge of adapting their militaries to an alliance that  increasingly emphasizes flexible and mobile forces that can be deployed rapidly to distant crisis  areas for long periods of time.</p>
<p>The basic dilemma that the eastern European states face today is whether  to join this effort to create high-tech expeditionary forces that can operate effectively with  other NATO units in remote areas, such as Afghanistan. Creating such forces would give NATO's new  members more political and military clout within the alliance. But it would require an expensive  shift of resources at a time when political calls for spending more money on social programs are  multiplying throughout the region.</p>
<p>NATO's force transformation also poses a significant psychological  challenge. Many officials in eastern Europe continue to think of security in terms of territorial  defense. In Poland, for example, many PiS leaders favor maintaining a large standing army based  on conscription in order to defend against a resurgent Russia. Reformers in the Polish Ministry  of Defense, however, argue that Poland needs a small professional army that can contribute to NATO's  new missions.</p>
<p>INTEGRATION IRRITATION</p>
<p>The EU's recent addition of eight members from eastern Europe -- and  the likelihood that it will add two more (Bulgaria and Romania) by 2007 or 2008 -- has had a significant  impact on the organization's political balance and decision-making. In particular, enlargement  has made it much harder for France and Germany -- the main motors of EU integration in the past -- to  drive the integration and enlargement processes in directions that could turn the EU into a counterweight  to U.S. power. The debates within the EU in the run-up to the Iraq war underscored the degree to which  enlargement has changed the political dynamics within the organization. Whereas France and Germany  opposed the war, the leaders of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland, together with the leaders  of Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, openly supported the U.S. position.  This rift made clear that Paris and Berlin did not speak for all of the EU and that the group's new members  were determined to have their say in the construction of the "new Europe."</p>
<p>On the other hand, the slowdown in reform within the EU since the Lisbon  summit in the spring of 2000 -- where member states resolved to strengthen the EU's research capacity,  promote entrepreneurship, and facilitate the exploitation of information technologies -- has  made the new members' integration more difficult. The richer countries have been increasingly  unwilling to allocate large sums of money to help the poorer ones. At the insistence of big contributors  such as Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, the budgetary guidelines adopted in December  2005 allocated fewer funds to the newer members than many people in those countries felt was deserved.  The "services directive" adopted by the EU's Council of Ministers at the end of May 2006 was another  slap in the face for the new members. They wanted better access for their service workers and companies  to the entire EU. The measure was supposed to create a single borderless market for service providers,  who represent more than two-thirds of the EU's economic output. But the final version of the directive  was significantly watered down by France and other western European states who feared an influx  of cheap workers (the infamous "Polish plumbers"), who would presumably steal jobs.</p>
<p>Economic protectionism within the older member states has, in fact,  increased in the past year. Calls for economic patriotism have given rise to efforts to create national  champions designed to protect key strategic industries from foreign competition. Hence, the  Spanish government encouraged a merger between the Spanish energy companies Endesa and Gas Natural  to prevent a takeover of the latter by the German utility giant E.ON, and the French government engineered  the union of the state-owned utility Gaz de France with the Belgian-French utility company Suez  to prevent Suez from being taken over by the Italian energy concern Enel.</p>
<p>A similar trend has developed in eastern Europe, where Euroskeptics  have gained ground. In early 2006, the EU threatened to take Poland to court when the PiS-led government  tried to block an attempt by UniCredit of Italy to merge a Polish bank it controlled with a German  bank it had recently purchased. Several weeks later, Poland provoked the ire of the EU by blocking  a measure on value-added tax that had been approved by all 24 other members.</p>

</div>
</div><p>However, the nationalist and populist parties in eastern Europe are  unlikely to take radical steps to cut their countries' ties to the EU. First, the Euroskepticism  of these parties is not shared by the populations at large. Polls consistently show strong support  for EU membership among the publics in all of these states. Second, the eastern European members  are major recipients of EU development aid. Poland, for instance, will receive nearly 60 billion  euros over the next seven years, making it the largest recipient of EU funds by far. Whatever their  discontent with EU policies, few eastern European leaders would be willing to renounce such largess.</p>
<p>IDENTITY CRISIS</p>
<p>Membership in the EU has also accentuated tensions between eastern  Europe's commitment to Atlanticism and its European identity. This has manifested itself most  acutely in the defense arena. In general, the countries of eastern Europe regard the U.S. presence  in the region as indispensable for their security and do not want to see it reduced. At the same time,  they do not want to be forced to choose between the United States and western Europe; they want good  relations with both. Hence, eastern Europeans were uncomfortable during the run-up to the Iraq  war when the Bush administration attempted to differentiate between "old" and "new" Europe, a  move they felt was aimed at forcing them to choose sides. This discomfort is also reflected in the  region's simultaneous support for a common European Security and Defense Policy and insistence  that links to NATO should not be weakened as a result.</p>
<p>These tensions have been felt most intensely in Poland, thanks to Warsaw's  particularly strong ties to Washington. Some EU officials have warned Poland that it should temper  its pro-American enthusiasm now that it is a member of the EU. Warsaw's decision to buy American-made  F-16s instead of fighters built by European countries particularly irritated EU officials, who  felt that as a member state Poland should have kept its purchasing within the continent. As Romano  Prodi, head of the EU Commission at the time, bluntly warned Warsaw in April 2003, "You can't entrust  your purse to Europe and your security to America."</p>
<p>It would be wrong, however, to assume that the new entrants into the EU  will automatically follow the U.S. line on all issues. On many foreign policy issues, especially  Iraq, popular attitudes in eastern Europe do not differ markedly from those in the rest of Europe.  Such attitudes constrain how much even populist or nationalist governments can deviate from the  European mainstream. Moreover, eastern Europeans have strong economic reasons to maintain close  ties to "old Europe," especially Germany, which is the main trading partner and leading investor  for many of these countries.</p>
<p>Even in Poland -- the most pro-American country in eastern Europe --  there has been a perceptible growth of popular support for the EU, particularly among the young.  This is in part an outgrowth of Poland's increasing integration into Europe. But it also reflects  disenchantment with current U.S. policies, especially on Iraq. More and more Poles have come to  question whether Warsaw's unqualified support for Washington on Iraq serves Polish interests.  There is also a feeling among many Poles that the Bush administration takes Polish support too much  for granted and is unwilling to accommodate important Polish interests, especially the desire  of Poles to travel to the United States without a visa. If these sentiments continue to grow, they  could weaken Warsaw's traditionally strong pro-American orientation.</p>
<p>NEW TIES THAT BIND</p>
<p>Changes in the political climate in eastern Europe are also affecting  patterns of interaction within the region. During the last decade, eastern European states displayed  a high degree of regional solidarity. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia created  the Visegrad Group to promote economic and political cooperation and coordinate policy before  the first round of NATO and EU enlargement. Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,  Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia banded together to create the Vilnius Group, or V-10,  in 2000 to promote solidarity and cooperation among aspiring NATO members.</p>
<p>Although the countries of the new Europe share a number of features --  particularly the desire to shed the political and economic shackles imposed by communism and to  integrate into Euro-Atlantic institutions -- they are a diverse group with very different historical  and cultural traditions and different levels of economic development. Slovenia has more in common  with Hungary and Austria, for instance, than it does with Bulgaria or Romania. Poland has stronger  ties to the United States than it does to many countries nearby -- or to western Europe, for that matter.  Even among the Baltic states -- perhaps the most homogenous group in the new Europe -- there are important  differences. Lithuania has strong historical ties to Poland and considers itself to be as much  a part of central Europe as of the Baltics. Estonia maintains closer ties to Finland than to most  countries in eastern Europe.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>As the goals of EU and NATO membership are attained, the regional cooperation  evident in recent years could give way to existing differences and lead to new alignments. Poland  may gravitate toward NATO's "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), for  example, while Hungary may come to cooperate more closely with countries in central Europe, such  as Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia, and regions such as Bavaria. The Baltic states, in turn, may  align their policies more closely with those of the Nordic states.</p>
<p>At the same time, new political ties are beginning to emerge. The most  significant development in this regard has been the far-reaching rapprochement between Poland  and Ukraine since the early 1990s. Historically, relations between these two states have been  characterized by considerable tension and mistrust. Over the last decade and a half, however,  the two countries have succeeded in overcoming their animosities and have developed remarkably  cordial relations. This reconciliation has been buttressed by an expansion of economic ties and  military cooperation, exemplified by Warsaw and Kiev's decision to set up a joint battalion to  participate in international peacekeeping operations under NATO and the UN. The unit has already  been successfully deployed to Kosovo.</p>
<p>The recent collapse of the Orange coalition, however, is a major setback  for efforts to anchor Ukraine more closely to the West. The new national unity government, headed  by Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, is dominated by corrupt oligarchs and figures from the discredited  Kuchma era. Although President Viktor Yushchenko favors a pro-Western course, including eventual  membership in NATO and the EU, his power has been reduced by constitutional reforms introduced  in January 2006 that increased the powers of the prime minister.</p>
<p>The reversal in Ukraine is likely to have a significant impact on the  other ex-Soviet states in the area and make it much harder for Georgia and Moldova to pursue their  own westward courses. Moscow may be tempted to step up pressure on both countries to curtail their  ties to Europe and the United States. In Belarus, President Aleksandr Lukashenko -- Europe's last  surviving dictator -- will feel free to tighten his autocratic rule with impunity.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Orange coalition is a defeat for Poland in particular.  Warsaw had been the strongest advocate of Ukraine's integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions,  and former Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski played a key role in brokering a deal to resolve  the crisis in Ukraine in November and December 2004. With the collapse of the Orange coalition and  the return to power of forces Warsaw helped defeat two years ago, the Polish government has been  forced to scramble to retain some influence with Kiev.</p>
<p>RUSSIA'S RETURN</p>
<p>The changes on Europe's eastern periphery have been reinforced by the  reemergence of Russia as a significant regional and international actor. Under Boris Yeltsin,  Russia adopted a policy of benign neglect toward most of the former Eastern bloc and, except for  a vocal and ultimately unsuccessful effort to stop the first round of NATO enlargement, largely  ignored the region.</p>
<p>This period of indifference has now ended. President Vladimir Putin  has embarked on a systematic effort to restore Russian influence in eastern Europe and its periphery.  Rather than relying on military power, as his Soviet predecessors did, Putin has sought to use economic  instruments -- above all Russia's energy exports -- to expand Moscow's power and clout.</p>
<p>In the Baltic states, Russia has sought economic influence over Latvia's  energy sector by targeting the oil export terminal at Ventspils, which is one of the few ice-free  winter ports in the Baltic region. In early 2003, the Russian state monopoly Transneft stopped  oil deliveries to Ventspils, causing serious economic losses to the port. Transneft maintained  that it cut back because it was sending oil to its own terminal at Primorsk, on the Gulf of Finland.  The real aim of the move, however, appears to have been to force the management of Ventspils to sell  control of the port to Transneft.</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--6">

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Russia has employed similar tactics in Lithuania. In July, Transneft  halted crude oil deliveries to the Mazeikiai refinery, Lithuania's largest oil refinery. The  rupture came just weeks after a deal between the Lithuanian government, the Russian state-controlled  oil firm Yukos, and Poland's PKN Orlen that would have allowed PKN Orlen to purchase the facility.  Most observers saw the halting of oil shipments as an attempt to tilt the deal in Yukos' favor.</p>
<p>Putin has also sought to use the energy weapon against Yushchenko. Moscow's  decision in December 2005 to significantly increase the price of gas it sold to Kiev had some economic  justification -- Ukraine had been paying below-market prices for Russian gas -- but it was clearly  calculated to increase Ukraine's economic difficulties and weaken Yushchenko on the eve of Ukraine's  parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Russia's reemergence as a strong, self-confident political and economic  actor in its neighborhood has coincided with another important trend: the intensification of  the relationship between Russia and Germany, especially in the field of energy. Under former Chancellor  Gerhard Schröder, Germany followed a "Russia first" strategy, with Berlin giving priority  to improving its ties, especially its economic ones, with Moscow. The most controversial aspect  of this growing economic cooperation has been the agreement to build a gas pipeline beneath the  Baltic Sea directly connecting Germany and Russia. The agreement was signed shortly before Schröder  left office in September 2005. (He has since gone to work full-time for the Gazprom-led consortium  building the pipeline.) The deal provoked an outcry in Poland and the Baltic states because it would  allow Russia to cut off the gas to these countries without affecting the supply to western Europe.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe's hopes that Germany's policy would shift under Chancellor  Angela Merkel have been disappointed. Although Merkel has pursued a less overtly pro-Russian  policy than did Schröder, the change has largely been one of tone and style, not substance.  Merkel has continued to give priority to increasing economic ties to Russia and has refused to cancel  the Baltic pipeline.</p>
<p>The intensification of Russian-German cooperation worries many eastern  Europeans, who fear that it could lead to a "new Rapallo" -- that is, that Russia and Germany will  collaborate behind the backs of eastern Europe and the West, as they did between the two world wars.  These fears are exaggerated, however. The Treaty of Rapallo was a product of a particular set of  circumstances: cooperation between two international pariahs who needed each other. Today,  Germany is thoroughly integrated into the West through a myriad of ties. While it has important  economic interests in Russia, it is not likely to pursue these at the expense of its links to the West.</p>
<p>To allay eastern European anxiety, Germany needs to balance its strategic  interest in economic cooperation with Russia with a more dynamic Ostpolitik. The centerpiece  of this should be an intensified effort to improve relations with Poland, which have significantly  deteriorated since the era of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and are badly in need of repair.  Berlin should therefore make the improvement of relations with Warsaw a top priority.</p>
<p>This effort at rapprochement, however, cannot be a one-way street.  Poland also has to do its part. To date, the Polish leadership has shown little interest in reaching  out to Germany. Such a policy, however, is short-sighted. Warsaw cannot afford a go-it-alone strategy,  especially at a time when Moscow is flexing its energy muscles. It needs allies, above all in Berlin.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON'S OSTPOLITIK</p>
<p>Developments in eastern Europe demand greater attention in Washington.  This is all the more urgent because the process of EU integration is stalled and Moscow, buoyed by  rising oil prices, is in an assertive, self-confident mood. Eastern Europeans are unsettled by  these trends, and they are looking for signs that the United States still takes their security seriously.</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--7">

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>One of the most important steps Washington could take would be to ease  the tighter visa restrictions imposed after 9/11. The restrictions are a source of great resentment  throughout the region and have contributed to a decline in the number of eastern Europeans able  to study in and travel to the United States. Easing these strictures would remove a major irritant  in relations between Washington and the region and do much to improve the United States' image there,  especially among the younger generation.</p>
<p>In addition, Washington should not try to sow division within Europe  or play off one part of it against another, as some in the Bush administration are inclined to do.  Such a policy is counterproductive. It will not only alienate key western European allies whose  support is necessary to manage new security challenges, but it will also make the leaders of eastern  European states uncomfortable. They do not want to be forced to choose between the United States  and Europe.</p>
<p>What the United States should do instead is promote eastern Europe's  closer integration into the EU. Germany's presidency of the EU in the first half of 2007 will provide  a good opportunity to give political impetus to this enterprise. Such an effort could give new momentum  to the German-U.S. partnership -- which was badly frayed in the Schröder years -- and reaffirm  the United States' commitment to enhancing stability and security in Europe in the aftermath of  the split over Iraq.</p>
<p>Washington should also encourage Poland to play a constructive role  in Europe and to do more to strengthen its ties to its neighbors, especially Germany. A good relationship  between Warsaw and Berlin is a prerequisite for stability in central Europe. Given its good relations  with both countries, Washington could play an important role in fostering better links between  the two.</p>
<p>Missile defense is likely to become an important issue in bilateral  relations between the United States and Poland. Warsaw has expressed interest in the possible  deployment of a missile defense system on its soil. Washington, however, should not take Warsaw's  acquiescence for granted. Any agreement will need to be ratified by its Parliament, and the Polish  government will need to show how a missile shield could enhance its own security, not just that of  the United States. Washington needs to recognize the political nature of the debate in Warsaw and  do a better job of providing the Polish government with factual data on the benefits of deployment  on its territory. The impact on security in the broader Baltic region, including relations with  Russia, will also need to be considered.</p>
<p>Finally, the United States should support Ukraine's integration into  Euro-Atlantic institutions, including NATO. However, given uncertainty about the orientation  and priorities of the Yanukovych government, it would be prudent to give Kiev time to show its colors  before offering it a "membership action plan." However, the door to membership should be kept open  for Ukraine if it succeeds in moving forward with a vigorous and coherent program of political,  economic, and military reform.</p>
<p>Taken together, these steps would help put U.S. relations with eastern  Europe on a firmer footing and strengthen the process of European integration. Ultimately, U.S.  interests are best served by the emergence of a strong, cohesive Europe.
