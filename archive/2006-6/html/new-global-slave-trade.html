<p>When most people think about slavery -- if they think about it at all -- they  probably assume that it was eliminated during the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, this is  far from the truth. Slavery and the global slave trade continue to thrive to this day; in fact, it  is likely that more people are being trafficked across borders against their will now than at any  point in the past.</p>
<p>This human stain is not just a minor blot on the rich tapestry of international  commerce. It is a product of the same political, technological, and economic forces that have fueled  globalization. Just as the brutal facts of the Atlantic slave trade ultimately led to a reexamination  of U.S. history -- U.S. historiography until the 1960s had been largely celebratory -- so must growing  awareness of the modern slave trade spark a recognition of the flaws in our contemporary economic  and governmental arrangements. The current system offers too many incentives to criminals and  outlaw states to market humans and promises too little in the way of sanctions.</p>
<p>Contemporary slavery typically involves women and children being  forced into servitude through violence and deprivation. Disturbingly, the advanced industrial  states have failed to to take much action to address the issue. The problem is one of political will,  not capability, for the rich countries of the world have at their disposal numerous instruments  that, if their leaders had the courage to use them, could greatly curtail the global slave trade.  Just as the British government (after much prodding by its subjects) once used the Royal Navy to  stamp out the problem, today's great powers must bring their economic and military might to bear  on this most crucial of undertakings.</p>
<p>After all, ending slavery is not simply a moral crusade, as compelling  as the moral case may be. There are also important self-interested reasons why the West should lead  a charge to eliminate this practice. The fact of the matter is that the same people who engage in human  trafficking also contribute to the deepening criminalization of the world economy overall, often  operating in close association with corrupt officials around the world. By allowing slavery to  go unpunished, states unwittingly erode the foundations of the international economic system,  which requires that governments be capable of enforcing bilateral and multilateral agreements  and the rule of law.</p>

</div>
</div><p>Tragically, although the strongest states have the greatest capacity  to suppress the slave trade, they have not done so, and key opportunities for action have been lost.  The European Union (EU), for example, should have used accession talks with potential new members  to pressure them into limiting the trafficking of their female citizens to the West. Meanwhile,  President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice may have made some bold pronouncements  about eliminating slavery, but the U.S. administration is so focused on the war on terror that Bush  and Rice rarely press matters such as slavery at meetings with relevant governments.</p>
<p>Such a shortsighted approach is dangerous not just for the people who  end up as slaves around the world but for anyone with a stake in the future of globalization. The costs  of inaction are rising; already, they are too high to bear.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC</p>
<p>The modern global slave trade generally involves the use of deception  and coercion to induce victims to cross national borders in search of new jobs; once the target has  arrived in a foreign country, he or she (and it is usually a she) is then forced into some form of labor  bondage. Although hard figures are difficult to come by, in June 2006, the U.S. government estimated  that some 600,000-800,000 people were subjected to such treatment each year. This number does  not include the many millions of people who are held as forced laborers within their home countries,  such as in India and Myanmar. When those individuals are taken into account, the total number of  people estimated to be living in some form of forced servitude around the world (according to the  International Labor Organization) grows to 12 million. Whatever the exact number is, it seems  almost certain that the modern global slave trade is larger in absolute terms than the Atlantic  slave trade in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was.</p>
<p>Approximately 80 percent of today's slaves on the global market are  female, and up to 50 percent are under the age of 18. According to the United Nations (UN), these victims  span the globe, being trafficked "from 127 countries to be exploited in 137 countries." Most of  the slaves come from countries such as Albania, Belarus, China, Romania, Russia, and Thailand,  while the most frequent destinations for traffickers are in Asia, followed by the advanced industrial  states of western Europe and North America and a number of states in the Middle East (including Israel).  The slave trade is also a major problem in Africa -- where children are often forced to serve as soldiers  -- but relatively little is known about the traffic in this region.</p>
<p>Once slaves arrive at their destinations, they typically are forced  to serve one of several functions. Approximately 43 percent of those in the global market are used  for sex, while another 32 percent are forced into other forms of unpaid labor, working as domestic  servants, construction workers, or, occasionally (in the case of very young boys), as camel jockeys  in the Persian Gulf states. The rest are pressed into both sexual and economic services. Governments  and international agencies differ about these precise figures, since it is somewhat easier to  calculate the numbers of persons forced into sexual servitude than it is to figure out how many are  forced into bonded labor. Indeed, the number of men who are trapped as indentured laborers is likely  underreported.</p>
<p>What all slaves have in common is that they are forced to work. Slavers  typically recruit poor people in poor countries by promising them good jobs in distant places.  A recruiter will then offer a victim a generous loan -- at an exorbitant interest rate -- to help with  travel arrangements, papers, and locating a job in the new community. On arrival, the promised  job never materializes, and thus the large debt -- up to several thousand dollars -- can never be  repaid. The victim is then stripped of all travel documents, given a false identity, and forced  into a job. He or she -- and his or her family -- are threatened with disfigurement or death should  the slave try to alert the authorities or escape. If they are paid at all, slaves get the bare minimum  required for survival.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>As the persistence of the slave trade suggests, it is a profitable activity.  The UN estimates that human traffickers earn around $10 billion per year and that the average sale  price for a slave is around $12,500. Since operating costs (for transportation and false documents)  are estimated to be approximately $3,000 for each slave, slavers can earn nearly $10,000 per victim.  It is worth noting that the cost of a slave today is far less than what African slaves once fetched  in the antebellum United States -- a difference owing in part to cheap modern transportation.</p>
<p>As a result of the low entry costs of the modern slave trade, the business  is dominated by numerous criminal gangs instead of one large mafia. These gangs are mainly from  Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America; the authorities do not know whether they are part of larger  syndicates or are specialists in human trafficking. Besides easy profits, the slave trade offers  another advantage to criminals: the risks of arrest are low and the penalties are relatively light.  In the United States, for example, drug traffickers generally face much stiffer sentences than  do those who traffic in humans.</p>
<p>In order to thrive, the slave trade requires the direct or indirect involvement  of national governments, at both the source and the destination. Since profits are high, slavers  have plenty of money to pay off government officials and local police. In certain countries, these  criminal links go to the very top. For example, in a September 2005 memorandum to Secretary of State  Rice, titled "Presidential Determination With Respect to Foreign Governments' Efforts Regarding  Trafficking in Persons," President Bush stated that the Cambodian government had "failed to address  the trafficking complicity of senior law enforcement officials" in that country and that the Myanmar  military was "directly involved in forced labor." Bush also singled out a number of other governments  -- including those of Ecuador, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela -- for failing to "show a serious  commitment" or to devote "sufficient attention" to stopping human trafficking in their countries.  If ordinary criminals are rarely punished for dealing in slaves, high-level officials in such  places enjoy even more impunity.</p>
<p>A CONVENTIONAL APPROACH</p>
<p>Ever since the abolition of the Atlantic slave trade, slavery has been  recognized as the most abhorrent violation of a person's liberty. The practice runs counter to  the entire modern history of human rights. Indeed, one of the UN's first acts after its establishment  was to pass the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation  of the Prostitution of Others, which the General Assembly approved in 1949. That convention updated  international agreements from 1904 and 1910 on the "suppression of the white slave traffic." Although  it dealt largely with prostitution, the 1949 treaty was far more ambitious in certain respects  than anything that has been proposed in more recent times. In fact, the convention's blanket condemnation  of all forms of prostitution and brothels looks almost quaint by today's standards, given the number  of governments (such as, most famously, that of the Netherlands) that have since legalized the  sex trade.</p>
<p>The most authoritative modern international agreement aimed at the  slave trade is the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially  Women and Children, which was approved by the UN General Assembly in 2000 after the G-8 (the group  of leading industrial countries) declared its support for such an undertaking earlier that year.  This agreement, which supplemented the UN's Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime,  reflected a growing awareness among world leaders of the role of organized crime in global commerce.  Unlike earlier slavery treaties, the protocol does not mention prostitution; instead, it aims  to serve as the "universal instrument that addresses all aspects of trafficking in persons."</p>
<p>The most difficult issue faced by the diplomats who negotiated the treaty  was how to define "human trafficking" in the first place. The confusion stemmed from the fact that  it is often difficult to distinguish workers -- even sex workers -- who voluntarily take large loans  at high interest rates in order to work abroad from those who are coerced into doing so and end up in  bonded servitude. Separating the two groups requires establishing a clear definition of "deception"  and "coercion" -- no mean feat.</p>
<p>Reflecting the work of a committee, Article 3 of the protocol defines  "human trafficking" awkwardly as "the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or  receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction,  of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or  receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another  person, for the purpose of exploitation."</p>
<p>It is not hard to see why governments that have signed the protocol have  found it hard to incorporate this definition into their criminal codes. In 2000, the United States  took the lead by passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which was signed into law  by President Bill Clinton and reauthorized and strengthened by Bush in 2003. The TVPA, which is  widely regarded as a model for other countries, establishes a more precise definition of what constitutes  human trafficking, imposes stronger penalties than had previously existed, and allocates funds  for compensation to the victims of human trafficking and for cooperation efforts with foreign  countries.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>The TVPA also requires the State Department to issue an annual Trafficking  in Persons Report that, among other things, classifies countries according to their efforts to  halt the slave trade. There are now 32 countries on the State Department's "Tier 2 watch list," a  list of those governments that are making efforts to comply with antislavery treaties but in whose  countries compliance is still weak, [see footnote 1] and another 12 on the "Tier 3" list, a list of those  governments that are making little effort to halt the slave trade.[see footnote 2]</p>
<p>Since the passage of the TVPA, the United States has charged 189 individuals  with sex trafficking, up from only 34 during the five years before the law went into effect. Federal  prosecutors have won 109 convictions in these cases, up from 20 in the preceding period. Sentences  have ranged from 16 months to 23 years. The U.S. government has also charged 59 defendants with labor  trafficking (two major cases involved 24 of these individuals). These cases led to, among other  things, the first-ever extradition of Mexican citizens to the United States to face labor-trafficking  charges.</p>
<p>As a result of the TVPA, the United States has been much more successful  in cracking down on slave traders than have most other countries. For example, according to the  UN, in 2003 Lithuania prosecuted 24 traffickers but convicted only 8 of them, and Ukraine prosecuted  59 but convicted only 11. Among those countries that provide figures, only the Netherlands has  a better record than the United States of prosecuting those involved with the slave trade.</p>
<p>Despite these accomplishments, the TVPA is far from perfect. For one  thing, law enforcement officers have complained that it is difficult to implement. One California  police officer who was interviewed about the legislation reported that in one of his cases "half  the 30 men arrested ... were deported instead of prosecuted" for their crimes. Another major  problem that prosecutors face is how to get victims of human trafficking, who fear the repercussions  for themselves and their families, to testify against their oppressors.</p>
<p>The TVPA has also failed to help the U.S. government make much of a dent  in the global slave trade, for several reasons. To begin with, the available data suggest that only  a relatively few slaves enter the United States each year. The Justice Department reported in 2006  that about 17,500 persons are trafficked into the country annually; in the late 1990s, the CIA put  the figure at about 50,000. Even if one accepts the higher figure, this still means that the vast  majority of slaves are traded outside the United States.</p>
<p>Yet most other governments have not made combating the slave trade as  high a priority as Washington has. This includes many western European governments, which (with  a few notable exceptions, such as in Sweden and the Netherlands) have done little to stop the flow  of slaves from the East. As a result, ever-increasing numbers of young women and girls are being  forced to work the streets of France, Germany, and Italy. This is despite the fact that Europe has  numerous nongovernmental organizations and media outlets concerned with the issue. Outside  Europe, where such forces play a much smaller role, the situation is even worse. In Thailand, for  example, traders who bring in Myanmar women for prostitution are rarely prosecuted. In Russia,  government officials show little concern over the plight of young women trafficked into or out  of their country. And in the Persian Gulf, the use of slaves for prostitution, domestic service,  and camel jockeying remains widespread even though it has been illegal since the 1960s.</p>
<p>Although the United States has sought to cooperate with foreign governments  in combating the slave trade, it has rarely punished a country for failing to act against human trafficking.  It is probably no coincidence that the lists of noncompliant states include important oil producers  (such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia), key allies in Washington's war on terror (such as Uzbekistan),  and great powers (such as China, India, and Russia). Under U.S. law, the president has the authority  to impose economic sanctions on states that fail to combat the slave trade by blocking foreign aid  and military assistance. Unfortunately, this is rarely a useful tool, since most of the countries  in question either do not receive U.S. aid or are of such compelling importance to national security  that the president is unwilling to crack down on them. The Bush administration, like its European  counterparts, seems to feel that a few slaves should not be allowed to get in the way of high politics.</p>
<p>Instead, Washington and its allies in the industrial world have taken  the position that rather than target governments, they should focus their efforts on the demand  and supply sides of the slavery problem. But Western countries disagree about what those steps  should be. And even if they could reach some sort of consensus, such measures would be insufficient.  The slave trade will only come to an end when a few key states muster the will to use force to liberate  the victims.</p>

</div><p>Such a claim may sound needlessly provocative. It certainly flies in  the face of statements made by many European officials who argue that it would suffice to tackle  the demand side of slavery by legalizing prostitution in the industrial world, which would supposedly  reduce human trafficking by curbing the demand for slaves, or who argue that the supply side should  be addressed by promoting economic development and growth in poor countries. It also runs counter  to statements by UN officials, who generally focus on the need to strengthen the 2000 protocol --  for example, by educating police officers and prosecutors about its content.</p>
<p>The problem is that none of these measures will work. The demand-side  approach has already been tried -- most famously by the Netherlands, which legalized prostitution  in October 2000. The Dutch government has explicitly stated that its legalization of sex work was  meant to facilitate "action against sexual violence and abuse and human trafficking." The idea  was that once brothels were permitted and regulated, the police would be better able "to pick up  signs of human trafficking" and prevent it.</p>
<p>But the Dutch strategy has not achieved much. Sex slaves have continued  to enter the black market, providing their services at lower prices than those charged by prostitutes  in the officially sanctioned red-light district. The slaves work in areas such as railroad stations  and on those streets that are off-limits to legal prostitutes, and they attract clients who are  too poor to pay official prices. The police, meanwhile, have proved no more able than in the past  to stop such practices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sweden -- a country usually known for its relaxed attitudes  toward sexuality -- has taken the opposite tack, criminalizing the buying of sex. Since 1999, when  this new law was introduced, some 750 men in Sweden have been charged with seeking to purchase the  services of a prostitute, a crime punishable by up to six months in jail. The Swedish government  claims that this policy has greatly reduced the number of prostitutes working the country's streets  -- although it is possible that the law has merely driven Sweden's prostitutes and their clients  deeper underground.</p>
<p>Other countries have followed Sweden's lead to varying degrees, especially  penalizing those who prey on underage sex workers. Some states have even extended their laws to  acts committed by their citizens while abroad. France, for example, has played a leading role in  prosecuting "sex tourists," who seek pleasure in countries such as Thailand. The effects of such  policies have yet to be measured sufficiently, but even if laws criminalizing the buying of sex  could make a dent in the trafficking of humans into the industrial world -- changing the demand side  of the equation -- they would remain half measures given the number of people traded into slavery  each year. For example, all the prosecutions in the United States to date have only led to the release  of a few hundred victims of slavery. More action is therefore also needed on the supply side.</p>
<p>Many policymakers have suggested that promoting economic growth in  developing countries should be the next step, since this would supposedly eliminate slavery by  providing potential victims with an alternative. But economic growth alone will not stop this  plague, at least not anytime soon. It will take a huge amount of progress before citizens of the developing  world stop being tempted by the prospect of a good job in a rich country. And it is far from clear how  such progress should be achieved; it would certainly be unrealistic to expect the industrial world  to provide enough aid to make up the difference itself.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that slavery today seems to thrive in  some parts of the world because of economic growth, not despite it. In the Middle East, for example,  the demand for young camel jockeys has increased as more people have gained the means to bet on races  and as the stakes have increased. In fact, the history of slavery provides little evidence to suggest  that economic growth could help end it anywhere.</p>
<p>Rather than seek complicated and distant solutions, governments should  focus on a few concrete actions that could have a real impact on human trafficking in the short run.  An excellent way to start would be with the naming and shaming of traders and the governments that  support them. The United States has already gone further than any other country in this direction  with its annual Trafficking in Persons Report. But few people seem aware of the document, and the  Bush administration -- and the mass media -- should do much more to publicize its findings. Reputation  matters in today's global economy, and a reputation for harboring criminals is something no state  wants.</p>
<p>Naming and shaming can also work in other parts of the globe. For example,  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has recently started putting pressure on Myanmar both  through quiet diplomacy and through drawing greater public attention to the Myanmar government's  dismal human rights record. This policy seems to be working; even military juntas want respect,  and Myanmar's leaders seem to recognize that since they rely heavily on tourism for their supply  of foreign currency, bad press in foreign papers could inflict real material damage on their country.</p>

</div>
</div><p>Next, wealthy states need to do a better job of confronting countries  on the State Department's Tier 2 and Tier 3 lists, imposing economic sanctions on them if they do  not act to ban human trafficking. The EU should put pressure on accession candidates, such as Bulgaria  and Romania, and on member states, such as Latvia and Portugal, that allow slavery to continue or  take inadequate measures to stop it. After all, the EU sometimes exacts penalties on member states  that fail to meet their commitments in many other areas, such as industrial policy; surely, there  is an even stronger case to be made where slavery is involved. For its part, the United States must  not allow its focus on the war on terrorism to distract it from acting on this issue. Washington has  allowed too many states -- especially oil producers, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- to get away  with too much for too long. Under the TVPA, the United States already has the authority to impose  economic sanctions on states that fail to act against the slave trade. The Bush administration  should also remember that governments that allow this scourge to thrive are unlikely to be reliable  allies when it comes to other problems that concern the United States.</p>
<p>To complement sanctions, Western states should also empower their  police, intelligence, and military forces to act much more aggressively against those who traffic  in humans. Just as force was ultimately needed to halt the slave trade in the nineteenth century,  so will force be necessary in some cases today. Current international treaties on slavery do not  authorize the use of force against slavers, but bilateral agreements should be strengthened to  allow such measures. The TVPA already provides funds to support international cooperation against  slavery. When it is next reauthorized by Congress, in 2007, lawmakers should add provisions explicitly  stating that such cooperation should extend to military and intelligence forces.</p>
<p>It is worth remembering that in the nineteenth century many people argued  that slavery would end "naturally" once the practice was no longer economically profitable. But  historians now agree that since slavery remained extremely profitable until the day it was abolished,  such an end was unlikely ever to come. If this was true in the past, it is even more true today, since  the costs associated with the slave trade have shrunk so dramatically. As long as slavers continue  to face only mild penalties from a handful of countries -- and none from the rest -- they can be expected  to continue their work, undermining in the process the legal and ethical foundations of the global  economy. If the United States and some of its European partners wish to halt modern slavery, they  will have to use their power to do so, just as the Royal Navy halted the Atlantic slave trade on the  high seas in the nineteenth century. There is no "natural" end to slavery in sight, and any productive  policy must start by recognizing that fact.</p>
<p>The time has come to tackle the slave trade once and for all, in the interest  of not only the people most directly affected but the broader public as well. As usual when it comes  to politics, Abraham Lincoln said it best: "In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to  the free." Halt the global slave trade today, and all citizens of the world will benefit. Allow the  practice to continue, and all will ultimately suffer.</p>
