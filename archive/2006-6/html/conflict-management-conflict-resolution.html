<p>The recent fighting in the Levant presents a fundamental challenge for U.S.  policy toward the Middle East -- but also an opportunity to move from conflict management to conflict  resolution. The United States should seize this moment to transform the cease-fire in the Hezbollah-Israeli  conflict into a step toward a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace settlement. Doing so would facilitate  the marginalization of the forces of Islamic radicalism and enhance the prospects for regional  security and political, economic, and social progress.</p>
<p>The Hezbollah-Israeli confrontation has further proved what should  already have been painfully clear to all: there is no viable military solution to the Arab-Israeli  conflict. Even with its military superiority, Israel cannot achieve security by force alone or  by unilateral withdrawal from occupied territories. Nor can Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic  Jihad, and similar groups destroy Israel. Peace can come only from negotiated agreements that  bind both sides.</p>
<p>Hezbollah may have ignited the spark that set off this latest confrontation,  but it is not the root cause. The fighting was the combined result of the unresolved Arab-Israeli  conflict and the struggle between the forces of moderation and those of extremism within the Muslim  world -- two issues that are linked by the radicals' exploitation of the Arab-Israeli conflict  for their own political ends. U.S. policy in the region should thus focus both on trying to promote  a peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute and on helping Muslim moderates by facilitating  political and economic reform across the Middle East.</p>
<p>THE NORTHERN FRONT</p>

</div><p>The crisis on the Israeli-Lebanese border this summer erupted in an  already tense environment. On June 25, Hamas kidnapped an Israeli soldier, which reignited fighting  on the Israeli-Palestinian front. When Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers on July 12, it  precipitated a strong Israeli military reaction, which, by his own admission, Hezbollah leader  Hassan Nasrallah had not anticipated.</p>
<p>The Hezbollah-Israeli war lasted 34 days, with major Israeli incursions  into Lebanon and the firing of some 4,000 Hezbollah rockets. The fighting resulted in major casualties  (approximately 855 Lebanese and 159 Israelis killed), as well as large displacements  of people on both sides of the border. Lebanon sustained economic and infrastructure damage estimated  at $3.9 billion, and the toll on Israel has been figured as running into the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>When the hostilities began, the international community called for  an immediate cease-fire, but the Bush administration held off, calling for a "sustainable" cease-fire  instead. The Bush administration left the strong impression that it was giving Israeli Prime Minister  Ehud Olmert's government time to inflict serious damage on Hezbollah's infrastructure and personnel.  Meanwhile, the administration and Israel clearly identified Iran and Syria as the main state supporters  of Hezbollah's actions, and the danger of a wider regional conflict was not dismissed.</p>
<p>Eventually, the international community stepped in to stabilize southern  Lebanon and prevent the crisis from escalating further. The parameters for international action  had been set by UN Security Council Resolution 1559, passed in 2004, which called for the withdrawal  of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the disarmament of Hezbollah. Resolution 1701, passed on August  11 of this year, refers to the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the presence of a UN force, and the commitment  of the government of Lebanon to extend its authority over its territory; it also takes note of proposals  regarding the Shebaa Farms area. In other words, it provides the necessary framework to support  the Lebanese government's development and the implementation of Beirut's plan to regain sovereign  control over the whole country.</p>
<p>Still, an outside stabilization program is urgently required to help  this happen. Such a program would need to include an agreement on a lasting and comprehensive cease-fire,  the return of both Israeli and Arab hostages and prisoners, and an international support package  involving economic, humanitarian, and security assistance for Lebanon. It would also need to  contain realistic plans for deploying the Lebanese army to the south of the country, disarming  Hezbollah, and preventing illicit arms shipments to Lebanon. And it would need to include a solution  to the disagreements over the control and sovereignty of Shebaa Farms. The successful implementation  of such a stabilization program would not just help resolve current tensions; it could also provide  the basis for moving forward on negotiations for an Israeli-Lebanese peace agreement in the context  of a comprehensive settlement.</p>
<p>Syria, meanwhile, poses both a danger and an opportunity. The Assad  regime could undermine security arrangements in southern Lebanon, hinder progress in Iraq, and  continue to support Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and radicals in Hamas. But it could  also play a constructive role in the region -- a possibility that has yet to be fully explored. The  Bush administration's engagement with the Syrians from 2003 to 2005 left both sides frustrated.  Washington felt that Damascus offered too little too late, and Damascus felt that Washington constantly  increased its demands and refused to be satisfied. Nevertheless, ever since the 1991 Madrid peace  conference, Damascus has looked to Washington as the key interlocutor between itself and Israel  in negotiations over the return of the Golan Heights. The extensive talks that took place during  the administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton may not have resulted in a final agreement,  but they came very close, hashing out the major issues of land, peace, security, and water.</p>
<p>The main problems on Israel's northern front now are Hezbollah and the  inability of the government of Lebanon to exert authority throughout the entire country. Since  Syria facilitates Hezbollah's access to arms and money, any sustainable solution in southern  Lebanon would require Syria to be on board. Given Syria's historically special relationship with  Lebanon, Damascus would not countenance a separate deal between Beirut and Jerusalem, and so the  Israeli-Lebanese and the Israeli-Syrian negotiating tracks will have to proceed in parallel.</p>

</div><p>If Syria is Hezbollah's facilitator, Iran is its key ideological, political,  and financial patron. Hezbollah is a grass-roots Lebanese Shiite political party and militia.  Nasrallah and the party decide and manage local political, social, and cultural issues on their  own, including tactical decisions on paramilitary operations against Israel. But the group recognizes  the absolute political and religious authority of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,  on doctrinal and strategic issues. Any sustainable agreement with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon,  therefore, would also have to involve Iran.</p>
<p>Dealing with Iran is problematic. Nevertheless, Washington and Tehran  have engaged each other on Afghanistan (constructively), Iraq (less so), and the nuclear issue  (as part of an international process). And although Iran sees it as being in its interest to have  the United States suffer in Iraq, it does not want U.S. policy there to fail and the country to slip  into full-scale civil war or territorial disintegration. Iran's population is just over half  Persian, but almost a quarter of the population is Azerbaijani and a small part is Kurdish or Arab,  making communal unrest a constant worry. Accordingly, the United States should consider dealing  more directly with Iran on specific areas of interest, disavowing regime change as a specific goal  and focusing on long-term policies to encourage and support political and economic liberalization  and indigenous reform efforts there.</p>
<p>THE PALESTINIAN FRONT</p>
<p>On the Israeli-Palestinian front, finally, it is critical to support  and reengage Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority (PA) as the focal  points of negotiations and move from managing the current fighting toward true conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Shortly before Hezbollah kidnapped the Israeli soldiers and triggered  the recent fighting on the Israeli-Lebanese border, the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue had reached  the beginning of a way out of that crisis. An understanding was being brokered by Egypt whereby the  Palestinians would commit to the safe release of the kidnapped Israeli corporal, Gilad Shalit,  Qassam rocket attacks would stop, and a cease-fire would be declared and maintained. There were  reliable reports that the Israelis were also prepared to release Palestinian prisoners to Abbas  in return for the cease-fire.</p>
<p>The formation of a national unity government between Fatah and Hamas,  which as of this writing seems possible, could be a step toward integrating Hamas into a more responsible  government. The external wing of Hamas, led by Khaled Meshal in Damascus, has demonstrated a more  militant and radical bent, while Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, who is from Hamas,  and his colleagues inside the territories are struggling with the requirements of governing and  have to consider difficult political compromises. U.S. policy should be sensitive to these political  dynamics and encourage Hamas to move in a more moderate direction.</p>
<p>The Quartet -- the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the  United Nations -- has laid out  the requirements that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist,  give up terrorism, and respect all signed agreements. Hamas is basically being asked to do what  other Arab governments have already done -- namely, accept all applicable UN resolutions and the  Arab peace initiative issued at the Arab League summit in Beirut in 1992, which called for recognizing  Israel in exchange for a comprehensive peace settlement. To move forward on the Palestinian track,  the Quartet should now promote a clearly delineated multistaged approach toward resolving the  political, security, and economic issues.</p>
<p>The political framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace is reiterated  in the road map and its call for a two-state solution; the task now is to detail the unilateral and  coordinated steps all sides must take before negotiations on a final peace settlement. Regarding  security, the challenge is to help stabilize the Palestinian territories, reform and reorganize  the Palestinian security services, disarm and integrate individual armed groups into the new  security force structure, and establish central control by the PA over the use of force. In both  the Palestinian and the Lebanese contexts, the success of disarmament and integration will ultimately  be the product of political agreements.</p>
<p>And on the economic front, the international community must help promote  reforms and avoid a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories, particularly Gaza,  by focusing on four key issues: the payment of monthly salaries to the PA's civil and police employees;  the financing of health, education, and social programs for the population at large; covering  the running costs of essential public institutions and municipal services; and the financing  of infrastructure projects. Israel should also be encouraged, with all due consideration for  its legitimate security needs, to increase the number of Palestinian workers inside its economy  and facilitate the movement of goods across its borders.</p>

</div><p>ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH</p>
<p>The extremists in the Muslim world today define the conflict with Israel  as an existential one, using terms similar to those prevalent in the region half a century ago. The  moderates accept the possibility of a political settlement based on the principle of land for peace;  for them, in other words, the issue is about Israel's borders, not about its existence. Security  Council Resolutions 242 and 338 (adopted in 1967 and 1973, respectively) embody this latter approach,  and the United States should resume its traditional role of pressing for their implementation.</p>
<p>After the Yom Kippur War, in 1973, President Richard Nixon and Secretary  of State Henry Kissinger led the effort to obtain the disengagement agreements between Israel,  Syria, and Egypt. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter brought Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin  and Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat together to sign the peace treaty between their two countries.  In 1991, President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker led the effort to bring Israel  and all of its immediate Arab neighbors together for the first time in direct negotiations in Madrid.  President Clinton presided over the signing of the Oslo accords on the White House lawn in 1993,  witnessed the signing of the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, and made a major effort  toward the end of his term in office that, while it did not lead to a signed agreement, defined the  contours of an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. This track record proves that with strong presidential  leadership, the United States can be an effective interlocutor between the Arabs and the Israelis.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush should therefore reiterate the vision of a  comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace settlement that he presented in June 2002, including his explicit  call for a two-state solution involving a Palestinian state living in peace and security next to  the state of Israel, and make it clear that he will work toward that end with the international community  for the remainder of his presidency. This could give the parties in the region the political space  they need to make the tough decisions and compromises for a negotiated peace. This thorough approach  to peace, which would bring all the Arab and Israeli parties together to address the issues on the  Palestinian, Lebanese, and Syrian fronts in a parallel manner, could be modeled after the Madrid  peace conference of 1991.</p>
<p>All of the key issues in the Middle East -- the Arab-Israeli conflict,  Iraq, Iran, the need for regionwide political and economic reforms, extremism, and terrorism  -- are inextricably linked. Nothing short of a comprehensive strategy can solve the problems,  marginalize the radicals, and promote the values and interests of the United States and the parties  in the region. Washington has waged war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The question now is whether it can  muster the political will to wage peace as well.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110425/ajax/content?token=y0e5OKtK-DC8ApoxTCFU2H_R4y1fMTb-Qfbwu2TCOPY" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
