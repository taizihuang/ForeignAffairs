<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nicholas Eberstadt (“The Dying Bear,” November/December 2011) is </span>surely correct that a rapidly depopulating <span class="s2">Russia would be confronted with a number </span><span class="s1">of essentially irresolvable economic, military, and political problems. However, data from Russia’s Federal State </span><span class="s3">Statistics Service suggest that over the </span>last decade, Russia’s demographic indica<span class="s1">tors have in fact been getting better. </span><span class="s2">Moreover, this improvement has intensified </span>since the onset of the 2008 global <span class="s3">financial crisis, confounding a number of </span>Western experts who predicted that the downturn would have a similar eªect <span class="s4">within Russia to that of the country’s debt </span>default in 1998, when fertility plummeted and mortality skyrocketed.</p>
<p class="p2">Russia’s demographic improvements are considerable: between 2000 and 2010, Russia’s rate of external mortality (deaths from vehicular accidents, alcohol poison<span class="s3">ing, murder, and suicide) decreased by 31 </span>percent, its fertility rate increased by 31 <span class="s4">percent, and its natural rate of population </span>loss (the rate at which the population is shrinking without accounting for immigration) fell by 75 percent. In fact, if one takes immigration into account, Russia’s overall population has essentially been <span class="s4">stagnant for the past three or four years</span> -- which would have been unfathomable ten years ago, when the country’s population was shrinking by a million people a year.</p>
<p class="p2">Eberstadt’s omission of any relevant <span class="s2">comparisons is troubling. For starters, more </span><span class="s3">enlightening than comparing Russians </span>to <span class="s4">Westerners -- Russians have been more </span><span class="s2">unhealthy, more drink-sodden, and shorter </span>lived than their counterparts in the West since public health statistics were first <span class="s4">collected in the late nineteenth century -- </span><span class="s3">would be comparing the Russians of today to the Russians of ten years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Also glaring is the omission of Ukraine, a country that neighbors Russia <span class="s3">and has performed significantly worse in </span>terms of demographics over the past decade. In 2010, despite having a population of only 45.8 million people, Ukraine had a natural population loss of 200,000. <span class="s1">In contrast, the so-called dying bear, </span>with a population of 142 million people, <span class="s3">naturally shrank by 240,000 that year. And it is not just Ukraine: that same </span>year, three other countries that neighbor <span class="s4">Russia -- Belarus, Latvia, and Lithuania -- </span><span class="s3">suªered natural population losses that were proportionally more severe than </span><span class="s2">Russia’s, as did Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary</span>, Romania, and Serbia. In other words, <span class="s5">postcommunist eastern European countries </span>are experiencing a systemic demographic crisis, which, in turn, suggests that <span class="s4">Eberstadt’s call to publicly berate Moscow </span>would not have much of an impact on Russia’s demographic outlook.</p>
