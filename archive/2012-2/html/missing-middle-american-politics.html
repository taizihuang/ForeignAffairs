<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><!--break--><p>After Lyndon Johnson’s victory over Barry <span class="s9">Goldwater in the 1964 U.S. presidential election, the once-mighty Republican </span><span class="s2">Party was reduced to a regional rump. The Democrats won overwhelming majorities </span><span class="s9">in the House and the Senate, which they </span><span class="s10">used to pass Johnson’s Great Society </span><span class="s2">legislation. Republicans, meanwhile, were </span>at one another’s throats, having endured the most divisive campaign in modern political history. Goldwater had managed <span class="s9">to win the Republican presidential </span><span class="s11">nomination over the impassioned </span><span class="s9">opposition of moderate and progressive Republicans, who at the time may well have constituted a majority of the party’s members. Moderates blamed Goldwater’s right-wing views for the defection of millions of Republican voters. </span>
</p>
<p class="p6">To rebuild the party, a number of moderate Republican governors banded <span class="s9">together to form the Republican Governors Association, designed to serve as a </span>counterweight to the Republican National Committee, which had been captured by Goldwater conservatives. Shortly after the election, the association <span class="s2">issued a statement, sponsored by Michigan </span>Governor George Romney and other leading moderates, calling for a more inclusive GOP and criticiz<span class="s9">ing Goldwater’s campaign. Stung by the </span>failure of many moderates to actively support or even <span class="s2">formally endorse his candidacy, Goldwater </span><span class="s10">retorted that he needed no lessons in maintaining unity, having urged party </span><span class="s2">members in 1960 to look past philosophical </span>differences and pull together to support Richard Nixon’s presidential candidacy. <span class="s10">Goldwater wrote a letter to Romney </span>dripping <span class="s9">with contempt: “Now let’s get </span>to 1964 and ask ourselves who it was in the Party who said, in effect, if I can’t have it my way I’m not going to play? One of those men happens to be you.”</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">Romney wrote a lengthy reply to Goldwater, warning against European-</span><span class="s12">style polarization. “Dogmatic ideological </span>parties tend to splinter the political and social fabric of a nation,” Romney wrote. <span class="s6">Worse, he added, political parties with fixed </span><span class="s9">ideological programs “lead to govern</span>mental crises and deadlocks, and stymie the compromises so often necessary to preserve freedom and achieve progress.” </p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s12">Romney’s words seem particularly prescient today, as polarized politics have </span><span class="s6">caused the U.S. government to seize up. But </span><span class="s2">what would the elder Romney, who died in </span><span class="s12">1995, have made of his own son’s embrace </span><span class="s2">of </span><span class="s6">a more orthodox conservatism -- the very </span><span class="s12">kind of politics the elder Romney feared would damage the country? </span></p>

Mitt Romney began his political career very much in the moderate mold. In 1994, running for the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts held by Ted Kennedy, the popular liberal Democratic incumbent, Romney forcefully maintained that he had been an independent during the Reagan years. On abortion, he was firmly <span class="s12">pro-choice. While Republican candidates </span>across the country were rallying around <span class="s2">Representative Newt Gingrich’s “Contract </span><span class="s6">With America,” Romney distanced himself </span><span class="s10">from it. “If you want to get something </span>done in Washington,” he said in a debate during the campaign, “you don’t end up picking teams with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other.” </p>

</div>
</div><p class="p8"><span class="s2">Romney’s defeat that year did not quite cure him of his moderate impulses. During </span><span class="s12">the battle for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, Romney, as a private citizen, purchased newspaper advertisements in New Hampshire criticizing the publisher and candidate Steve Forbes’ ca</span><span class="s2">ll for a flat tax, deriding it as “a tax cut for fat cats.” And as a 2002 gubernatorial candi</span><span class="s12">date in Massachusetts, Romney defeated a </span><span class="s2">weak Democratic opponent in large part </span><span class="s12">by touting his moderate bona fides. </span></p>
<p class="p8">Yet as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and now <span class="s9">2012, Romney has shifted decisively to </span>the right, embracing the party’s anti-tax <span class="s9">consensus, reversing his decades-long </span>support for abortion rights, and taking a much harder line on entitlement spending. He has been careful to avoid being outflanked on his right by his various <span class="s11">GOP rivals, attacking Gingrich and Texas </span><span class="s10">Governor Rick Perry for being insufficiently tough on immigration. </span>And he has generally cheered on House <span class="s10">Republicans in their fierce opposition to </span>President Barack Obama’s domestic <span class="s2">agenda. Departing from the more decorous </span>tone of his previous campaigns, Romney has described the president as “a crony <span class="s9">capitalist,” a “job killer” whose policies will “poison the very spirit of America </span>and keep us from being one nation under <span class="s12">God.” Like so many erstwhile moderates</span>, Romney has survived in today’s more <span class="s12">confrontational, ideological GOP by finally </span>picking a team. </p>
<p class="p8">COMMITMENT ISSUES</p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">The dominant ideology and style of today’s </span><span class="s12">Republican Party would have been utterly </span><span class="s2">alien to Romney’s father. In </span><span class="s6"><em>Rule and Ruin</em></span>, <span class="s10">the historian Geoffrey Kabaservice’s </span>vivid account of the pitched ideological battles that shaped the postwar Republican Party, George Romney is cast as the last hope of a moderate Republicanism <span class="s2">that has all but vanished. Born into poverty </span><span class="s12">in a Mormon colony in northern Mexico, Romney rose to become the chief execu</span><span class="s2">tive of the American Motors Corporation</span>. There, he succeeded in taking on the Big <span class="s9">Three car companies, scoffing at their “gas-guzzling dinosaurs” and offering </span><span class="s12">sleek, fuel-efficient compacts that anticipated </span>the later triumphs of the Japanese <span class="s2">automobile industry. Like many self-made </span>business executives of the time, Romney <span class="s10">felt a deep sense of moral obligation, which flowed in part from his devout </span><span class="s2">religious faith. As poor African Americans from the Deep South settled in and around </span>Detroit, Romney made it his mission to better their condition. Shortly after his <span class="s9">election as governor in 1962, Romney </span><span class="s12">pressed for a massive increase in spending </span><span class="s10">on public education and on generous </span><span class="s12">social </span>welfare benefits for the poor and unemployed. During Romney’s first term <span class="s12">alone, Michigan’s state government nearly </span>doubled its spending, from $684 million in 1964 to $1.3 billion in 1968. To finance <span class="s12">the increase, Romney fought for and won </span><span class="s10">a new state income tax, which would become a thorn in the side of future </span>Michigan Republicans. </p>
<p class="p8">What separated Romney from liberal Democrats who were similarly eager to expand government was his conviction that he was doing God’s work on earth. <span class="s9">Today, it is entirely common for Repub</span><span class="s12">lican presidential candidates to describe the </span><span class="s9">Declaration of Independence and </span><span class="s10">the Constitution as divinely inspired </span><span class="s9">documents, as Romney did. But in the </span><span class="s11">mid-1960s, as Kabaservice observes, </span><span class="s9">such religiosity was unusual, at least for </span><span class="s11">a moderate Republican. Kabaservice </span><span class="s9">briefly speculates that Romney’s brand of moralistic progressivism might have </span><span class="s2">resonated with many Christian voters who </span>instead embraced a harder-edged form of conservatism infused with evangelical fervor. But Romney’s political program <span class="s2">was badly undermined by the 1967 Detroit </span><span class="s12">riots, which discredited the notion, fairly </span><span class="s2">or not, that large-scale social spending was </span><span class="s12">the most effective route to social uplift, at least among conservatives.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s6">Disagreements on race and the Vietnam </span><span class="s10">War fueled the split in the late 1960s between the radical New Left and the liberal Democratic establishment. But </span><span class="s2">the upheaval of the late 1960s also divided </span>the Republicans. Conservatives of that <span class="s6">era saw themselves as defending the United </span><span class="s2">States’ founding ideals against communism abroad and radicalism at home. Moderates</span><span class="s12">, in contrast, sought to modernize the GOP</span>: <span class="s2">to keep up with the baby boomers’ shifting </span>sensibilities on social issues and to share in their embrace of a more diverse and dynamic society. Some even praised what <span class="s12">they saw, perhaps naively, as the freedom</span>-loving spirit of the antiwar movement. </p>
<p class="p8">Yet as Kabaservice relates, the moder<span class="s2">ates never coalesced into a movement with </span>a coherent program and ideology, despite Dwight Eisenhower’s earlier attempts to build a modern party that embraced the <span class="s10">New Deal and a vision of responsible </span>American global leadership. This failure <span class="s12">left moderate Republicans in an awkward position. Those who shared the Demo</span><span class="s6">cratic faith in activist government, tempered </span>by a desire for decentralization and fiscal <span class="s10">rigor, found themselves gravitating to </span><span class="s9">the </span>left. Those who shared conservative skepticism of big government, tempered by a recognition that Social Security and <span class="s12">Medicare were here to stay, found themselves </span>gravitating to the right. There was no glue to hold the two sides together.</p>

</div>
</div><p class="p8">Ultimately, Kabaservice argues, it was this lack of coherence that doomed the <span class="s2">centrists within the Republican Party. The </span>absence of a rigid ideology freed them to embrace creative solutions to emerging <span class="s9">social problems, which proved useful </span><span class="s12">when they were in power. But precisely </span><span class="s2">because they were so allergic to ideology, </span><span class="s10">the moderates were disinclined to rally the troops or to wage scorched-earth </span><span class="s9">cam</span><span class="s2">paigns against their political enemies. </span><span class="s9">Even when they had the advantage of </span><span class="s2">numbers, </span><span class="s12">as they did after Goldwater’s </span><span class="s2">1964 defeat, they routinely failed to coordinate their efforts, never managing to build </span><span class="s6">the kind of grass-roots fundraising network </span><span class="s9">that fueled the rise of the political right.</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">Instead of offering a set of clear </span><span class="s12">political commitments, moderate Re</span><span class="s9">publicans instead asked voters to trust </span><span class="s12">their </span><span class="s9">judgment, to have faith that intelligent, thoughtful, evenhanded leaders would </span><span class="s12">govern well. After Vietnam and </span><span class="s2">Watergate, however, Americans hungered </span><span class="s12">for politicians with clear convictions, leaders who would never betray them. This was true on the left but even more so on the right. And the surest way to guard against </span><span class="s6">betrayal was, and still is, to force politicians </span><span class="s12">to commit themselves to a well-defined set of propositions. In the 1960s, that meant no recognition of communist China; today, it means no new taxes. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">There is no question that such commitments reduce a politician’s room </span><span class="s12">for maneuver and make legislative com</span><span class="s10">promise difficult, if not impossible. But political commitments also increase </span><span class="s2">democratic accountability, which is prized </span><span class="s12">by many voters, especially educated ones</span>. <span class="s11">Although today’s political landscape </span><span class="s9">might frustrate those who are eager for </span><span class="s11">pragmatism and bipartisanship, there is </span><span class="s9">no question that the Democratic and Republican Parties represent distinctive priorities and visions. </span></p>
<p class="p9"> </p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s13">KEYNESIANS AND CONNALLYS</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s10">Kabaservice is searingly critical of the conservative movement that eventually triumphed within the GOP. His chief </span><span class="s9">complaint is the distance between what </span><span class="s12">conservatives have said and how they have </span><span class="s9">governed. In a particularly vivid passage </span><span class="s11">lamenting the failures of George W. Bush’s presidency, he writes that “a </span><span class="s12">Republican Party without moderates was </span><span class="s9">like a heavily muscled body without a </span><span class="s10">head.” After Bush’s 2004 reelection, </span><span class="s12">Republicans held majorities in the House </span><span class="s10">and the Senate for the fifth straight election, but, Kabaservice observes, </span>“conservatives proved unable to achieve <span class="s12">their goals, largely because they lacked the </span><span class="s10">ideas the moderates had once provided </span><span class="s12">and the skill at reaching compromise with </span><span class="s10">the opposition at which moderates had </span><span class="s9">excelled.” The irony of the decline of the </span><span class="s2">moderates is that it made the achievement </span><span class="s10">of conservative goals all but impossible. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">Indeed, as conservative rhetoric has grown increasingly hostile to government since the mid-1960s, the size of government has continued to expand, even when conservatives have been in power. Bush himself, having promised </span><span class="s12">to restrain the growth of the government</span><span class="s9">, </span><span class="s2">presided over an increase in federal spending </span><span class="s9">as a share of GDP from 18.2 percent </span><span class="s12">in 2000 to 20.7 percent in 2008, reversing </span><span class="s9">the trend under his Democratic </span><span class="s2">predecessor. And between 1950 and 2009, state </span><span class="s10">and local spending increased as a </span><span class="s9">share of GDP from 7.7 percent to 15.5 percent. Even in states where conservatives have dominated, such as Nevada and Texas, </span><span class="s10">spending has increased at an alarming rate as conservatives have aped their liberal foils, responding to a growing </span><span class="s9">appetite for public services by increasing spending rather than by improving the productivity and efficiency of existing institutions. And at the federal level, conservatives have generally acquiesced to increased spending while refusing to levy taxes high enough to pay for it. In effect, this has meant delivering big </span><span class="s12">government while only charging for small </span><span class="s6">government -- a politically attractive prop</span><span class="s12">osition </span><span class="s9">that has proved fiscally ruinous. </span></p>
<p class="p8">Moderate Republicans have been among those most attuned to the perils of such hypocrisy. During the late 1960s, a number of moderate Republicans -- such as those associated with the Ripon Society, a think tank that served as an incubator for centrist policies -- correctly <span class="s12">predicted that a southernized GOP, shaped by a fusion of conservatism and populism</span>, would “have an enormous appetite for federal subsidies in the form of defense spending, oil allowances, and agricultural <span class="s12">supports,” Kabaservice writes. Indeed, the conservative appetite for federal spending </span>grew ever more voracious in the decades that followed. Call it redistribution for me, but not for thee. </p>
<p class="p8">As president, Nixon ratified the ascendance of big-government conservatism with his embrace of John Connally, <span class="s9">a former Democratic governor of Texas </span><span class="s11">whom Nixon appointed as treasury </span>secretary in 1971. Whereas moderate and <span class="s9">conservative Republicans alike tended to </span><span class="s10">favor the decentralization of power, </span>competitive markets, and private initiative, Connally was a different animal. He was a foreign policy hawk and a cultural conservative but also an avid defender of subsidies and tax breaks for the defense sector and energy interests, which fueled the Sunbelt boom and further enriched hundreds, if not thousands, of wealthy conservatives. Nixon saw Connally as his natural successor, a politician who could cement Nixon’s new Republican majority by bringing the southern white working class into the fold. Although Connally never lived up to Nixon’s high hopes, he did help usher into the GOP a generation of statist southern politicians keen to channel federal dollars to favored inter<span class="s9">ests in their region. Connally still casts a long shadow on the party: one can see it,</span> <span class="s2">for example, when a conservative governor</span><span class="s12"> such as Perry eagerly spends </span><span class="s10">millions of taxpayer dollars on Texas’ Emerging </span>Technology Fund, a program <span class="s2">that a more orthodox free-market advocate </span>would reject as an unacceptable intrusion into the private sector. </p>

</div><p class="p8">“We are all Keynesians now,” Nixon is sometimes reported to have said in 1971. (In fact, his remark was less sweeping: “I’m now a Keynesian in economics.”) But Nixon’s treasury secretary may have <span class="s2">left a more lasting mark on the Republican </span><span class="s9">Party than any economist. After </span>decades <span class="s10">of GOP support for subsidizing favored industries from defense to oil and gas to </span>Sunbelt housing construction, a cynic might argue that Republicans are all Connallys now. </p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s13">WEAK TEA</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2">The rise of the Tea Party movement briefly seemed like an intriguing exception to this </span><span class="s9">general drift. The movement has often been interpreted as a brand of populist conservatism virtually indistinguishable </span><span class="s12">from the supply-side conservatism of the Reagan era. But supply-side economics was an optimistic creed that rejected the </span><span class="s2">idea of the market as a zero-sum game and celebrated a vision of a flourishing society </span><span class="s9">in which everyone should, could, and </span><span class="s6">would </span><span class="s2">be richer, freer, and happier if taxes were low and GDP growth robust. The Tea </span><span class="s9">Party movement offers a far less sunny </span><span class="s2">worldview. Far from inheriting the opti</span><span class="s9">mism of the Reagan-era supply-siders, the </span>Tea Party shares more with the Old Right, the earlier form of conservatism that Reaganite supply-siders derided as <span class="s12">“root-canal economics” for its emphasis on</span><span class="s2"> spending cuts -- and, in some cases, tax increases -- as instruments of hard-nosed </span>fiscal discipline. Like the Old Right, the <span class="s2">Tea Party conceives of the United States </span><span class="s12">as divided between those who work hard and play by the rules and those who game the system, whether by engaging in petty </span><span class="s9">welfare fraud or by seeking government favors through lobbying and campaign contributions.</span></p>
<p class="p8">This sentiment has not led to a <span class="s2">compelling critique of the country’s broken </span>financial and political systems, however. The fierce opposition of the libertarian <span class="s12">Republican congressman Ron Paul to the </span>Federal Reserve has earned him considerable standing among some grass-roots conservative activists. But for the most part, more realistic proposals to constrain the power of big banks and reduce the implicit and explicit subsidies that flow to them have fallen on deaf ears. Indeed, the Tea Party movement, like the con<span class="s12">servative movement of the 1960s and 1970s</span>, <span class="s10">seems deeply hostile to technocratic proposals of any kind, even those that could foster a more decentralized and </span>market-oriented society. </p>
<p class="p8">In <em>The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism</em>, the political <span class="s2">scientist Theda Skocpol and her co-author</span>, <span class="s2">Vanessa Williamson, draw on a wide range </span>of sources to describe the movement’s <span class="s2">origins and worldview. Although anchored </span><span class="s12">by extended conversations with individual </span>Tea Party activists, the book adds little to <span class="s2">the thousands of newspaper and magazine </span>articles that have been written about the Tea Party in the past few years, retracing an already familiar <span class="s12">portrait. Skocpol and </span><span class="s2">Williamson observe </span><span class="s6">that Tea Party activists </span><span class="s2">tend to be relatively affluent and middle-</span><span class="s9">aged or older. The vast majority vote </span><span class="s10">Republican, although some identify as </span><span class="s9">conservative-leaning independents. They tend to be wary of claims of </span><span class="s12">technocratic expertise and prefer citizen </span><span class="s9">engagement over deference to elites. Reverence for the U.S. Constitution is an essential aspect of the Tea Party’s </span><span class="s12">ideology, and members of the movement </span><span class="s9">often invoke the founding documents. Skocpol and Williamson also anatomize the three main components of the Tea Party movement: grass-roots organizations; well-funded national advocacy groups, such as FreedomWorks; and a </span>media nexus of Fox News and conservative <span class="s9">talk radio. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">Skocpol and Williamson attempt to maintain a disinterested tone. But they often cannot conceal their hostility to the Tea Party, the GOP, and conservatism more generally, as when they warn that Republicans “will continue to talk about ‘America going broke’ and the ‘need to slash spending’ and ‘cut taxes,’ without getting overly specific until just before they seize the chance -- if one presents itself -- to push through major restructurings of Medicare and Social Security.” The reader is left to conclude </span><span class="s12">that Skocpol and Williamson believe that </span><span class="s9">there is something sinister about trying to reduce the national deficit and that </span><span class="s12">efforts to restructure Medicare and Social </span><span class="s9">Security are wholly unrelated to the federal government’s fiscal woes. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">Still, Skocpol and Williamson rightly diagnose a major weakness of contem</span><span class="s12">porary Republican reform efforts. Because </span><span class="s9">conservatives have so strenuously made </span><span class="s10">the case against government and the welfare state, they have undermined </span><span class="s9">their credibility as champions of reform. </span><span class="s2">Scholars and voters alike are now skeptical </span>when conservative Republican reformers<span class="s9">, such as Representative Paul Ryan of </span><span class="s11">Wisconsin, promise that they intend to </span><span class="s9">put the U.S. social safety net on a sounder footing, not to destroy it. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s9">There is no doubt that a reliance on antigovernment rhetoric has created a </span><span class="s10">troubling vacuum at the heart of the </span><span class="s11">conservative project. The Tea Party movement and its rejectionism now </span><span class="s9">define public perceptions of the post-Bush Republican Party. And it is true that for years, congressional Republicans have been extremely reluctant to take on issues such as tax reform and health care -- the kind of issues that consumed </span><span class="s12">moderate Republicans in an earlier era</span><span class="s9"> -- </span><span class="s10">because conservatives see them as a </span><span class="s9">political and intellectual dead end. Now, </span><span class="s12">however, some Republicans, led primarily </span><span class="s9">by Ryan, have advanced a number of </span><span class="s2">significant proposals, including a sweeping </span><span class="s9">Medicare reform and a base-broadening </span><span class="s12">overhaul of the tax code. Ryan has shown </span><span class="s9">an openness to the ideas of the avowedly moderate Bipartisan Policy Center and even to raising tax revenues, a move that has long been anathema to conservatives. Late last year, Ryan signaled a willingness to compromise by joining </span><span class="s11">with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, </span><span class="s10">a Democrat, to advance a Medicare </span><span class="s9">reform proposal -- one that specifically addresses Democratic objections to an earlier plan Ryan had proposed. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s10">Around the same time, congres</span><span class="s12">sional Republicans experienced a sharp </span><span class="s11">political reversal in a showdown with Obama over extending a temporary payroll tax cut. Republican brinkmanship, which had earlier threatened chaos during a battle over increasing the debt limit, was met with near-</span><span class="s9">universal opprobrium from the voting </span><span class="s10">public. After the Republicans gave in to Democratic and popular demands that the payroll tax cut be extended, </span><span class="s11">Obama experienced an immediate surge in his approval ratings. </span></p>

</div><p class="p7"><span class="s10">Conservative Republicans and their Tea Party supporters were chastened by this defeat, and the Tea Party’s grip on the GOP shows some signs of loosening. But moderate Republicanism will not return as a bona fide movement anytime soon, despite the efforts of right-of-center public intellectuals such as </span><span class="s2">David Frum and David Brooks. The social </span><span class="s10">group that contributed so heavily to the </span><span class="s8">moderate movement of yesteryear -- </span><span class="s10">upper-middle-class social liberals who </span><span class="s9">live in big cities and their suburbs -- has shifted overwhelmingly to the Democratic </span><span class="s10">Party, and it seems unlikely that those voters will ever return to the GOP. </span><span class="s9">Yet the moderates’ flexibility and pragmatism are experiencing a tentative </span>renaissance, as younger conservatives, led by figures such as Ryan, face up to their <span class="s10">movement’s shortcomings. Moderate Republicans may no longer exist, but their legacy persists, and conservative Republicans will need to recapture the </span>moderates’ creativity and problem-<span class="s10">solving impulses if they ever hope to take power, hold on to it, and govern effectively.</span></p>
