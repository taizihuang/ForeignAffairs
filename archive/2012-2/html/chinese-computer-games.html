<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>In March 2011, the U.S. computer security company RSA announced that hackers had gained access to security tokens it produces that let millions of <span class="s1">government and private-sector employees</span>, including those of defense contractors <span class="s1">such as Lockheed Martin, connect </span>remotely to their office computers. Just five months later, the antivirus software <span class="s1">company McAfee issued a report claiming </span>that a group of hackers had broken into <span class="s1">the networks of 71 governments, companies</span>, and international organizations. These attacks and the many others like <span class="s1">them have robbed companies and gov</span><span class="s1">ernments </span><span class="s1">of priceless intellectual property and crucial military secrets. And although officials have until recently been reluctant </span>to name the culprit, most experts agree <span class="s1">that the majority of the attacks originated </span>in China.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In response, analysts and policymakers</span> have suggested that Washington and <span class="s1">Beijing work toward some form of détente</span>, <span class="s1">a broad-based agreement about how </span><span class="s1">countries should behave in cyberspace that might eventually turn into a more</span> <span class="s1">formal code of conduct. Proponents argue that the two sides’ long-term </span><span class="s1">interests </span>are aligned, that one day China <span class="s1">will be as dependent on digital infrastructure for economic and military </span>power as the United States is today. As Major General Jonathan Shaw, the head of the British military’s Defence Cyber <span class="s1">Operations Group, has said, China’s </span><span class="s1">“dependence on cyber is increasing, the </span><span class="s1">amount of cyber crime taking place </span><span class="s1">inside </span><span class="s1">that society is huge, and the impact </span><span class="s1">on </span>their economic growth and their internal stability is also going to be huge. . . . There’s more common ground than people might suggest.”</p>
<p class="p3">But a grand bargain won’t be struck <span class="s1">anytime soon. Both China and the United </span>States consider operations in cyberspace a valuable tool, and China currently has <span class="s1">little interest in cracking down on hackers</span>, <span class="s1">who pose a constant threat to its economic and military rivals. This doesn’t </span>mean that there is nothing Washington <span class="s1">can do, however. Instead of engaging in a </span>futile effort to achieve some equivalent in cyberspace to nuclear détente, the U.S. government should pursue a wide-<span class="s1">ranging approach to protecting American </span><span class="s1">interests that includes working closely with other Internet powers and raising the costs of hacking. Cyberattacks are less like on-off switches and more like </span>dials. The goal of U.S. policy should be to turn them down.</p>
<p class="p4">INTERNET IDEOLOGY</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Washington and Beijing won’t agree to a </span><span class="s1">broad treaty governing cyberspace mainly </span>because they hold fundamentally incompatible views on the Internet and society.<span class="s1"> The U.S. government, in its International </span>Strategy for Cyberspace, says that it will promote a digital infrastructure that is “open, interoperable, secure and reliable” <span class="s1">while supporting international commerce</span>, strengthening security, and fostering free <span class="s1">expression. It has championed an approach </span>to the Internet that lends influence to commercial interests and nonstate actors, opposing calls from other countries for <span class="s1">more authority to be given to state-centric </span><span class="s1">organizations such as the UN or the </span>International Telecommunication Union.</p>

</div><p class="p3">China, by contrast, regulates the <span class="s1">Internet strictly, and although the country </span>may share an interest in security and <span class="s1">global commerce, it defines these concepts </span>differently than the United States does. It is not that China has nothing to fear from cyberattacks: the country suffered <span class="s1">close to 500,000 such attacks in 2011, with </span>nearly 15 percent of them appearing to <span class="s1">come from computers in the United States</span>. Yet this vulnerability has not brought the two sides together: whereas Americans <span class="s1">talk of promoting “cybersecurity,” a </span><span class="s1">fairly </span>narrow term that implies protecting communications and other critical networks, Chinese officials like to talk about “information security,” a much <span class="s1">broader concept that also includes </span>regulating content.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">China’s stance is a matter of legitimacy </span><span class="s1">and political control. Chinese policymakers, unlike their American equivalents, fear that communications technologies could foment instability. </span>Beijing views attempts by the U.S. State <span class="s1">Department and digital activists to over</span><span class="s1">come Internet filters as just as threatening as hackers trying to penetrate </span>an electric <span class="s1">power grid. Thus, in June 2011, for exam</span><span class="s1">ple</span><span class="s1">, responding to reports that the </span><span class="s1">United </span><span class="s1">States was developing an “Internet </span>in a <span class="s1">suitcase” and other firewall-circumvention </span>technologies, an editorial in the state-run <em>People’s Daily</em> contended, “The U.S. State <span class="s1">Department has carefully framed its support of such projects as promoting </span>free speech and human rights, but it is clear that the policy is aimed at destabilizing national governments.” </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">China’s obsessive drive for indigenous </span><span class="s1">innovation explains its opposition to </span><span class="s1">global standards for both the technologies </span><span class="s1">that keep the Internet operating and those </span>that allow different types of devices to communicate online. As Chinese tech<span class="s1">nology firms expand abroad, they will need an interoperable Internet as badly </span>as any other international businesses, and <span class="s1">they would benefit from the economies </span><span class="s1">of scale and lower prices that global standards allow. For this reason, the </span>Chinese computer manufacturer Lenovo <span class="s1">helped found the Digital Living Network </span><span class="s1">Alliance, a trade group that seeks to </span><span class="s1">promote interoperability among consumer </span>electronics. But the Chinese government <span class="s1">views such attempts at unity as an effort to </span><span class="s1">lock the rest of the world into technology </span>standards dominated by U.S. companies. As part of its plan to reduce its technological dependence on the West, China <span class="s1">has proposed technology standards of its </span>own.</p>
<p class="p4">CHINA’S CHOICES</p>
<p class="p2">In February 2011, weeks after Google publicly announced that hackers had <span class="s1">tried to steal its sensitive computer codes</span>, security experts traced the attacks back to Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a vocational school in Shandong Province. <span class="s1">Both schools denied any involvement, and it is possible that their computers </span>were hijacked by others, but U.S. intel<span class="s1">ligence officials claim that 20 groups </span>associated with the People’s Liberation Army and several Chinese universities are responsible for the majority of the attacks on Google, RSA, and other U.S. <span class="s1">targets. Attributing responsibility is often </span>hard. Some hackers drift in and out of Beijing’s orbit over time, whereas others are independent criminals with no links to the state. Overall, however, much of the hacking originating in China can be classified as government-sponsored or government-tolerated. Beijing sees such hacking as a good way to eke out economic and military advantage -- which <span class="s1">creates another obstacle in the path of a </span>U.S.-Chinese agreement.</p>
<p class="p3">China’s motivation in this area is not mysterious. The government desperately wants its economy to move up the value chain, to become a source of innovation <span class="s1">rather than just a producer of cheap goods</span>. <span class="s1">To make that happen, it has employed the traditional instruments of science and technology policy, but it has also </span><span class="s1">relied on industrial espionage directed at </span>foreign high-tech companies. Hackers have reportedly targeted the negotiation strategies, business plans, and financial information of foreign energy and banking companies, too. </p>
<p class="p3">Beijing also tolerates cyberattacks out of concern for internal stability. In some cases, the government appears to direct attacks at its domestic enemies, such as the Falun Gong movement, whereas in others, it seems to encourage political hacking as a sort of release valve for frustrated citizens. During the late 1990s, <span class="s1">for example, the government called on </span><span class="s1">“patriotic hackers” to vandalize U.S. </span>government Web sites in response to the <span class="s1">U.S. military’s accidental bombing of </span><span class="s1">the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and the </span><span class="s1">collision of a U.S. surveillance plane </span><span class="s1">with</span> a Chinese fighter jet. The Chinese government’s attitude began to shift by <span class="s1">the middle of the next decade, when prominent editorials and high-profile arrests signaled that it was starting to </span>view independent hacking as unwanted interference in foreign relations.</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--3">
<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--3');
            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p class="p3">But Beijing has continued to allow such hacking during tense times. After the human rights activist Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in October <span class="s1">2010, for example, Chinese hackers defaced </span>the Nobel organization’s Web site, and after Vietnam asserted sovereignty over <span class="s1">contested islands in June 2011, they </span>targeted Vietnamese sites. In both cases, the government turned a blind eye to the <span class="s1">illegal hacking in deference to the population’s </span>nationalist impulses. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">China’s military also finds value in </span><span class="s1">cyberattacks, which would be an integral part of any Chinese military action in the region. Much of the Chinese open-source literature on information warfare suggests that the military, in the event of a conflict, would conduct quick cyberattacks on its </span><span class="s1">adversary’s command-and-control centers</span><span class="s1">. Although the People’s Liberation Army has recruited some high-profile hackers and set up “cyber-militias” at technology companies, the military would probably </span><span class="s1">stop short of rallying outside hackers during a conflict, since doing so would </span><span class="s1">cede control to them over picking targets and make it difficult to stop escalation.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Cyberattacks also help China send a <span class="s1">message of deterrence: that a limited </span>regional conflict might not stay that way. Chinese intrusions into U.S. power grids or other critical infrastructure, especially when evidence is left behind, act as a <span class="s1">warning that the U.S. homeland may not be immune to attack in the case of a </span><span class="s1">conflict </span>over Taiwan or the South China Sea.</p>
<p class="p4">PLAYING DEFENSE</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the obstacles standing in the way of a grand bargain, Washington should focus on improving its defenses, raising the costs to Chinese hackers, and cooperating with other Internet powers. The centerpiece of </span><span class="s1">any comprehensive strategy should be cooperating with the private sector to defend the country against computer </span><span class="s1">attacks, especially when they target intel</span><span class="s1">lectual property. The U.S. government has </span><span class="s1">already begun to make progress in this </span><span class="s1">area; since May 2011, for example, the National Security Agency has shared </span><span class="s1">classified intelligence on cyberthreats with 20 defense contractors and their Internet service providers. Although the Pentagon </span><span class="s1">is considering expanding the project to even more defense companies and to critical infrastructure sectors, such as </span><span class="s1">electricity generators and power grids, for the time being the rest of the U.S. private sector remains on its own. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is a problem, since the rash of successful attacks over the last five years suggests that U.S. firms need all the help they can get against their highly </span><span class="s1">capable Chinese foes. A mix of govern</span><span class="s1">ment regulations and incentives could push American companies to spend more on security. But since attackers </span><span class="s1">will breach defenses anyway, these </span><span class="s1">companies need to do a better job of protecting intellectual property and trade secrets. They should take inventory of all data stored digitally, remove critical information from vulnerable servers, limit the time hackers are able to spend on networks by deploying effective intrusion systems, and lure attackers into so-called honeypots, decoy computers sometimes baited with fake data.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The United States should also seek to raise the costs of cyber-espionage </span><span class="s1">through trade policy. As the defense </span><span class="s1">consultant James Farwell has argued, </span>China’s tight control over the Internet suggests that it has the ability, and thus the legal responsibility, to stop attacks coming from its soil. The United States could make the case to the World Trade <span class="s1">Organization that Chinese intellectual </span><span class="s1">property theft violates China’s WTO </span><span class="s1">obligations. A ruling against Beijing would allow Washington to label China a pirate state, collect damages or apply </span><span class="s1">trade sanctions, and help mobilize </span><span class="s1">international support for pressure on China. Even without a WTO ruling, the United States might consider levying </span><span class="s1">economic sanctions on China and placing </span><span class="s1">travel restrictions on cyber-spies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">More aggressive measures may be in </span><span class="s1">order but for now are legally and strate</span><span class="s1">gically difficult. The United States’ strategy in cyberspace has always been about more than just defense; as Chinese officials are quick to note, it was the United States that first set up a cyber command and thus, in their view, militarized cyberspace. Although U.S. defense officials have hesitated to talk about how they would attack other countries’ networks, this reticence is </span><span class="s1">hardly working. (Consider this headline </span><span class="s1">that ran in the <em>PLA Daily</em> on July 16,</span><span class="s1"> 2011: “The Offensive Posture of the U.S. ‘Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace’ is Difficult to Conceal.”) It is </span><span class="s1">time to give up the act. Chinese analysts </span><span class="s1">are no doubt aware that Washington is planning offensive operations, and they probably believe that it is behind other attacks -- in particular Stuxnet, the computer worm credited with slowing down Iran’s uranium-enrichment program at its facility in Natanz.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Last March, the Obama administration </span><span class="s1">considered using cyberattacks to </span><span class="s1">disable Libya’s air defense systems but </span><span class="s1">chose not to for various legal and </span><span class="s1">strategic reasons. The legal issues of responding to Chinese intrusions are </span>even more complicated, since espionage <span class="s1">does not violate international law and so does not justify large-scale attacks in response. In other words, the United States cannot turn off the lights in </span><span class="s1">Shanghai because terabytes of data were </span><span class="s1">stolen in Washington. Self-defense is allowed, but the authority under which the U.S. military can exploit foreign networks in defense of private industry </span><span class="s1">is unclear.</span></p>

</div>
</div><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Now that U.S. intelligence officials </span><span class="s1">have identified the specific groups </span><span class="s1">behind some of the attacks the country </span><span class="s1">has faced, the United States could target individual computers and personal or financial data. The U.S. government may have already hired private companies to conduct offensive operations in cyberspace. Several prominent security researchers have admitted selling previously undiscovered software vulnerabilities known as “zero-days” to defense contractors, who may use these exploits themselves to penetrate Chinese networks or may pass them on to U.S. government agencies. The benefits of contracting out hacking, however, must be weighed against the operational and legal issues that private but government-sponsored attacks would raise, as well as the damage they could do to diplomatic efforts to convince Beijing to rein in its own patriotic hackers.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">CREATING CONSENSUS</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Even as the U.S. government attempts </span><span class="s1">to defend itself against Chinese hackers</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s1">it must also work directly with the Chinese </span><span class="s1">government to try to solve the problem. It has taken some preliminary steps in this direction. In May 2011, for the first time, the U.S.-China Strategic and </span><span class="s1">Economic Dialogue included discussions </span><span class="s1">regarding cyberspace; such issues were </span><span class="s1">also on the agenda in July when Admiral </span><span class="s1">Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint </span><span class="s1">Chiefs of Staff, met with General Chen </span><span class="s1">Bingde, chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army. U.S and </span><span class="s1">Chinese officials, along with experts from </span><span class="s1">think tanks, have also been privately discussing these issues in a parallel set of track-two meetings. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Yet these official bilateral discussions are not expansive enough. Diplomats should take their cues from the planned dialogue on cyberspace between the United States and Russia, which is to include discussions about how each side’s military views the Internet and an effort to establish a hot line that could be used during a cybersecurity crisis. Washington and Beijing need to have a clear communications channel in case of emergency. To build trust over the longer term, the two sides should also discuss some common threats, such as the potential for terrorist attacks on power grids.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Negotiations on these topics are likely to be protracted and held hostage to the overall state of the U.S.-Chinese relationship. In the past, military-to-military discussions have often been canceled by one side or the other to </span><span class="s1">signal displeasure. Confidence-building </span><span class="s1">measures that reduce mutual irritants, such as a recent joint effort to reduce </span>junk e-mail, are more likely to be sustainable<span class="s1">. In the same vein, as Gu Jian, the deputy head of network security for China’s Ministry of Public Security, has suggested, the two sides could act against activity that is illegal in both </span><span class="s1">countries. For example, they might shut </span><span class="s1">down Web sites that attempt to trick users into handing over their bank account numbers. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps more promising than these incipient discussions with China is the U.S. government’s effort to work with allies and other like-minded countries to define international norms about </span><span class="s1">cyberspace. It is especially important to </span><span class="s1">find common ground with rising </span><span class="s1">powers such as Brazil, India, Indonesia</span><span class="s1">, and South Africa. Agreements with </span><span class="s1">them about acceptable behavior would </span><span class="s1">ratchet up the pressure on China, </span><span class="s1">which rarely prefers to remain an international </span><span class="s1">outlier. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Companies and governments should </span>also call out China for its hacking crimes <span class="s1">in the hope that this will embarrass the government into ending them. Google used this strategy when it announced in January 2010 that it had been the victim of sophisticated attacks and would no </span><span class="s1">longer operate its search engine in China</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s1">as did the U.S. State Department in </span><span class="s1">April 2011, when it pressed the Chinese Foreign Ministry about attacks against </span>a Web site supporting the dissident artist <span class="s1">Ai Weiwei. Naming and shaming, besides </span><span class="s1">highlighting the fact that Beijing is </span>violating international norms, may also <span class="s1">embolden those within the Chinese </span>government who worry that hacking’s <span class="s1">long-term costs -- in particular, the </span><span class="s1">dam</span><span class="s1">age </span>it does to relations with Japan, Europe, and the United States -- outweigh its short-term gains.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The U.S. government should also keep lending a hand to other countries </span><span class="s1">so that they can fight cybercrime on </span><span class="s1">their own, especially those developing countries that lack the relevant exper</span>tise. In July 2011, for instance, the State <span class="s1">Department sponsored a conference for </span><span class="s1">six East African countries on investigating and prosecuting cross-border cybercrime. If the United States does </span><span class="s1">not help such governments, China would </span><span class="s1">be happy to do so. Yet along with its </span>expertise, Beijing would seek to export <span class="s1">its own attitudes about the Internet, values that could tempt these governments </span><span class="s1">to adopt more totalitarian ap</span><span class="s1">proaches to cyberspace and join </span><span class="s1">China at the UN in its push to limit the </span><span class="s1">role of nongovernmental groups in Internet governance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Assembling an international con</span><span class="s1">sensus on norms about cyberspace, </span><span class="s1">however, is a strategy that will probably </span><span class="s1">take a long time to pay off, if it ever does. There is little the United States can do to alter China’s conception of </span><span class="s1">cyberspace, a vision it is actively promoting </span>abroad. With a growing population of <span class="s1">500 </span><span class="s1">million Internet users, it is easy to see </span><span class="s1">why the Chinese believe that the </span><span class="s1">future of cyberspace belongs to them. In </span><span class="s1">the meantime, the most pressing tasks </span><span class="s1">for the United States are to raise the </span>costs <span class="s1">incurred by Chinese hackers and to </span><span class="s1">improve the security of networks at home. Yet U.S. officials should be realistic: Chinese-based cyberattacks will not disappear anytime soon.</span></p>
