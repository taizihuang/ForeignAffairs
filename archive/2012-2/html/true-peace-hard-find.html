<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>After reading the compelling case made by Yosef Kuperwasser and Shalom Lipner in “The Problem Is Palestinian <span class="s1">Rejectionism” (November/December 2011</span>), <span class="s2">it was quite jarring to read the companion </span><span class="s3">piece, “Israel’s Bunker Mentality,” by Ronald Krebs.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Krebs’ argument boils down to this: Israel was doing quite nicely as a liberal, <span class="s4">secular state until 1967, when a war </span>mysteriously descended on it, and since <span class="s2">then an illiberal, ethnocentric nationalism </span>has taken over and redefined the country. <span class="s3">In the process, Krebs contends, Israel became enamored with the occupation </span><span class="s2">of territories acquired during the Six-Day </span><span class="s3">War, helped along by a growing ultra-Orthodox community and large-scale Russian immigration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">It is not until the essay’s very last para</span><span class="s1">graph </span>that Krebs notes, “Of course, Israel <span class="s3">cannot end the occupation alone.” Yet until that point, he gives precisely </span><span class="s4">the </span>opposite impression, namely, that it is <span class="s4">in Israel’s hands to bring the conflict to an end.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Poll after poll has revealed that a majority of the Israeli public supports a two-state agreement. Even as they have coped with deadly waves of terrorism, Hezbollah’s growing arsenal in Lebanon, <span class="s3">Hamas’ control of Gaza, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ refusal to negotiate</span>, most Israelis still believe that a two-state deal remains the best possible outcome.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4">Moreover, four consecutive Israeli prime ministers -- Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert, and Benjamin Netanyahu -- have endorsed the two-</span>state vision, acknowledging the need for a painful and risky territorial withdrawal <span class="s2">in exchange for a peace accord and an end </span>to the conflict. But it has not happened yet. Why?</p>

</div><p class="p2">According to Krebs, one reason is that <span class="s2">“Israel’s commitment to peace has . . . too </span>often been halfhearted.” History suggests otherwise. Barak, in collaboration with <span class="s2">U.S. President Bill Clinton, tried to strike </span>a breakthrough two-state deal with the <span class="s2">Palestinians until the very end of his term </span><span class="s1">in office. Sharon broke with his own Likud </span>Party to push through a total withdrawal from Gaza. Olmert went beyond Barak and Clinton, oªering Abbas the <span class="s4">equivalent of 100 percent of the West Bank. </span>And Netanyahu led his reluctant Likud <span class="s4">to accept the two-state principle and </span>agreed to an unprecedented settlement <span class="s2">freeze. Yet none of the four Israeli leaders </span>found a willing partner on the other side and therefore had nothing to show for his eªorts.</p>
<p class="p2">In the end, alas, neither the late Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat nor Abbas was willing to shatter the Palestinian people’s <span class="s3">dream of Israel’s destruction, which has been nurtured for more than 60 years. Nor were they prepared to abandon the “right of return” and thus affirm Israel’s legitimacy, whatever its final borders, as the Jewish homeland.</span></p>
