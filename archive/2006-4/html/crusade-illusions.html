<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>Over the past century, realism and liberalism have been the two warring imperatives behind  most U.S. foreign policies. According to these two stimulating new books, the United States and  its policymakers have seldom managed to reconcile these two approaches or match ideologically  driven liberal projects with the realities of power, interest, and expense.</p>
<p>The United States is struggling with just such a problem at the moment. The administration of  George W. Bush, like some of its predecessors, claims to be both realistic and true to American ideals.  In 2002, Condoleezza Rice, when she was still national security adviser, asserted that the administration's  emphasis on both preventive war and democracy promotion (articulated in its 2002 National Security  Strategy) transcended what she called the false academic dichotomy between realism and idealism.  "In real life," she declared, "power and values are married completely." And Bush has denigrated  skeptics "who call themselves 'realists'" but "have lost contact with a fundamental reality" -- that  "America is always more secure when freedom is on the march."</p>
<p>Events, however, do not seem to be cooperating. Washington is currently mired in a costly war  that is part of a dubious strategy of democratic regime change. And a fierce fight has broken out  within the neoconservative brain trust: Francis Fukuyama has denounced Charles Krauthammer's  strategy of "democratic realism" (which advocates the use of military force and elections to transform  the Middle East), arguing that it is neither democratic nor realistic.</p>
<p>Both Christopher Layne, of Texas A&amp;M, and Colin Dueck, of the University of Colorado, point  out that such tensions are nothing new; indeed, the United States' liberal ambitions have, since  the era of Woodrow Wilson, repeatedly clashed with the realities of power politics. Layne and Dueck  converge in some of their analyses, but they diverge in their prescriptions. For example, Layne  proposes to resolve the conflict between liberalism and realism through a strategy of engagement  so limited that it borders on isolationism. Dueck, by contrast, seeks a prudent balance between  modest liberal ambitions and politically sustainable commitments. In the end, both are too pessimistic  about Washington's ability to shake off its ideological impulses and find the right balance. A prudent  realism is not only compatible with the achievement of liberal U.S. aspirations in world politics;  it is a precondition for success.</p>
<p>THE PERILS OF PRIMACY</p>

</div><p>Layne and Dueck are not mere pundits reacting to depressing headlines, but political scientists  who have spent serious time in the archives and ground their criticisms in coherently articulated  philosophical positions. Layne, who has warned readers for years about the dangers of American  hubris in a unipolar world, has earned the right to say, "I told you so."</p>
<p>Like many eclectic younger scholars of international relations, Layne and Dueck call themselves  "neoclassical realists." This means that they anchor their analyses in questions of the relative  power of states and their national interests but allow for the role of other factors, such as ideology  and domestic politics. International politics, in this view, is not inexorably condemned to be  a Hobbesian tragedy -- but it can turn into one if states are misguided by their illusions.</p>
<p>The United States' physical distance from Eurasia has sometimes tempted it to remain aloof  from what happens there. Yet the country has enjoyed such preponderant power that it has also been  tempted to impose abroad what Layne calls "Open Door hegemony" -- demanding that countries open  their economies, conform to U.S. ideas and institutions, and unquestioningly accept U.S. leadership.  Although this situation might seem advantageous, it is (as both authors point out) actually dangerous.  Layne shows how Washington's ideologically motivated assertions of hegemony repeatedly provoke  fear and resistance abroad, embroiling the United States in costly and counterproductive contests  with other countries. Dueck, meanwhile, worries that U.S. policymakers too often try to pursue  their liberal goals on the cheap, in ways that risk failure and bring on rash attempts to stave off  humiliating defeats.</p>
<p>The two books offer overlapping accounts of U.S. grand strategy since the presidency of Woodrow  Wilson but trace distinct historical plot lines. Layne focuses on the way that the country has repeatedly  squandered its luxuries of power and insularity to pursue the goal of liberal dominance in Eurasia.  During World War II, Layne writes, the country aimed to "throttle Germany and Japan" and "knock  Britain from its great power perch." When the war was over, the "political collapse of Europe" gave  Washington the chance to consolidate its hegemony.</p>
<p>In Layne's telling, confronting the war-weakened Soviet Union was almost an afterthought.  Stalin, he claims, actually wanted to pursue détente with the United States and was only dissuaded  when the Marshall Plan revealed U.S. intentions to force open Eastern Europe and achieve hegemony  on the continent. Layne unconvincingly asserts that Harry Truman could have struck a deal with  Stalin to set up Germany as an independent state, thereby reestablishing a balance of power in Eurasia  and allowing the United States to withdraw across the Atlantic. But Washington rejected that option;  with its "huge superiority in power, it did not need to be overly concerned about how Moscow would  respond to American policy." Instead, as Layne quotes the diplomatic historian Melvin Leffler,  "American leaders -- moved by a traditional missionary impulse, convinced by their global responsibility,  full of the self-confidence that comes of success, fundamentally unhurt by war in a wounded world -- eagerly  reached for the mandate of heaven."</p>
<p>Layne sees the subsequent Cold War in Europe as having been more about maintaining U.S. economic  access and keeping the United States' NATO allies down than it was about keeping the Soviets out.  And after the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States continued its quest for hegemony -- proof,  according to Layne, that Washington had always had ambitions beyond just keeping Moscow from dominating  Eurasia. These ambitions, Layne writes, are what explains the United States' present predicament  as well. "Fundamentally, 9/11 was about geopolitics," he declares, "specifically about U.S.  hegemony. ... It is American policies -- to be precise, American hegemony -- that make  the United States a lightning rod for Muslim anger."</p>
<p>Given the costs, why has the United States worked so hard at maintaining an "open door" around  the world? Layne points to a confluence of ideological fears and economic interests. Without presenting  much evidence, he asserts that "the United States has pursued hegemony because that grand strategy  has served the interests of the dominant elites that have formed the core of the U.S. foreign policy  establishment since at least the late 1930s."</p>

</div><p>His account, however, is far too one-sided to convince, and Layne is wrong on many key issues.  In his historical overview, he ignores the fact that the U.S. decision to withdraw from active participation  in balancing power in Eurasia in the 1930s was a disaster, and that the U.S. victory in the Cold War  came cheap compared to other historic contests for hegemony. Moreover, Stalin would never have  accepted a deal to set up a truly independent Germany, because he rightly feared a rerun of World  War II. And NATO was created because the Europeans pushed for it; if anyone was ambivalent about  it, it was the U.S. Congress, which was reluctant to fund ongoing troop deployments abroad. More  generally, Layne is right to worry that U.S. dominance may provoke resistance. But he overlooks  the critical fact that during the Cold War, most states balanced against the weaker but more threatening  Soviet Union, rather than against the stronger but more attractive United States. The result of  such skewed historical judgments is that Layne unfairly dismisses the possibility that a consensual  international order based on prudent, liberal American leadership could emerge.</p>
<p>LIBERALS ON THE CHEAP</p>
<p>Dueck's account is more differentiated and better explains the United States' current impasse.  He argues that U.S. grand strategy has typically been marked by an ideological commitment to remake  the world in the United States's own liberal self-image -- and by a countervailing urge to do it  on the cheap. This cheapness, and the habit of what he calls "limiting liability," comes, according  to Dueck, from tradition ("no foreign entanglements"), geography (the oceans make it feasible),  and institutions (the brake exercised by Congress) -- all of which he lumps together as "culture."  Dueck finds examples of this pattern throughout U.S. history: in Wilson's inability to secure  U.S. membership in the League of Nations; in Truman's attempt, pre-1950, to contain the Soviet  Union with inadequate military forces; in Bill Clinton's Bosnia policy; and in Bush's invasion  of Iraq with a small army and no plan for the occupation.</p>
<p>Unlike Layne, Dueck not only expounds his main theme but also explains variations on it. He classifies  strategic schools by their degree and type of liberalism and by the extent of their concern with  limiting liability. Thus, for example, he considers Progressives (such as Henry Wallace and George  McGovern) to be liberal idealists who seek to limit U.S. commitments abroad. Internationalists  (Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, and John F. Kennedy) are liberals who expand U.S. commitments.  Nationalists (Robert Taft and Jesse Helms) seek to limit liability and the relevance of liberal  ideas in foreign affairs. And realists (Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge) also set aside liberal  ideals in foreign affairs but are more willing to use force to compete for dominance abroad. According  to Dueck, which school prevails at a given moment depends in part on the international situation:  rising threats diminish the instinct to limit liability. In practice, this means that rising threats  normally play into the hands of liberal internationalists, because realism does not resonate  with the United States' liberal political culture.</p>
<p>Although he notes these general patterns, Dueck is not a determinist. He argues that the outcomes  of struggles over grand strategy ultimately depend on electoral politics and how presidents shape  options and build coalitions. He shows, for example, how Wilson's ideological framing of the peace  issue and Republican political tactics in 1919 removed from consideration the perfectly plausible  options of a more limited League of Nations or a postwar alliance with the United Kingdom and France,  even though the realist Republican establishment favored such options.</p>
<p>For Dueck, Bush's grand strategy after September 11 "was the result of a pattern of strategic  adjustment that has occurred repeatedly and predictably in American history: international  shocks and pressures created an opening for new strategic ideas, and leading state officials took  the opportunity to put forward their preferred approach, based largely on their culturally influenced  perceptions of the national interest." In other words, "as [Secretary of Defense Donald] Rumsfeld  put it, September 11 offered 'the kind of opportunities that World War II offered, to refashion the  world.'" Bush explained in February 2003 that "a liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to  transform that vital region." But Bush pursued these "extremely ambitious and idealistic foreign  policy goals without initially providing the full or proportionate means to achieve those goals,"  says Dueck, which made Bush "very much a Wilsonian."</p>
<p>Dueck underrates the continuity between the pre-9/11 realist phase of the Bush administration,  with its inclination toward tough bargaining and its skepticism about nation building, and its  later turn to preventive war and belligerent rhetoric about democracy promotion. For key figures  such as Vice President Dick Cheney and Rumsfeld, the democracy subtheme in "the war against terror"  was mainly window-dressing for a policy of security through the use of force.</p>
<p>Even so, the rhetoric mattered. Like Wilson, Bush used his agenda-setting powers to limit and  polarize the available policy choices on Iraq. He removed from consideration moderate options  favored by many experts, such as applying steady pressure on Iraq or pursuing limited aims. Thanks  to the crisis atmosphere after September 11 and the grandiosity of ambition underwritten by unipolarity,  Bush's call to wage a war on "evil" initially gained the backing of over 80 percent of Republicans,  Democrats, and independents.</p>
<p>Dueck argues that grand strategies generally persist until they have been proved a failure  and are overturned in an election. Would that it were so. In fact, support for the Vietnam War, for  example, declined steadily from 1966 to 1971 among Democrats, Republicans, and independents,  and the party that started the war was thrown out of the White House in 1968. Yet Washington continued  the war until 1973, albeit after adjusting troop deployments to reduce casualty levels.</p>

</div>
</div><p>Today there is a new, more polarized pattern. In the 1980s and 1990s, even as Republicans and  Democrats moved further apart on domestic issues, the differences between them on foreign policy  remained comparatively minor, and partisan opinions on both sides changed in response to events.  Bush's reframing of U.S. foreign policy since September 11 has changed that pattern. Republican  support for the Iraq war has eroded only modestly in the last three years, even as support from Democrats  and independents has taken a nosedive. This pattern of polarization extends to issues unrelated  to the war: in 1998, for example, polls indicated that 31 percent of Republicans believed that the  globe was warming, but by 2004 they showed that only 26 percent did (even as the numbers increased  among Democrats and independents).</p>
<p>What does all this portend for the Bush variant of Wilsonian internationalism? The answer is  not clear. Failure plus an election usually means change, Dueck argues. But he also stresses presidents'  ability to use foreign threats to set the strategic agenda to suit their purposes. Although there  is no precedent for anyone managing this trick after a failed war, the persistence of Republican  support for Bush's strategy of preventive war, combined with widespread nervousness over Iran's  nuclear program, could breathe a second wind into the administration's sails.</p>
<p>DELIMITING LIBERALISM</p>
<p>If Bush's grand strategy of regional transformation in the Middle East does collapse, will  it be replaced by something better? Layne argues for "offshore balancing," which relies on a regional  balance of power emerging spontaneously among Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, as the United States  uses its air force and navy to oversee things from afar. But Layne does not hold out much hope that  this strategy will be adopted. Dueck's prescription -- to scale down liberal aims so that they  can be matched with sustainable policy -- is less of a departure from the pre-Bush norm, but he,  too, is skeptical that Washington will ever find the right balance.</p>
<p>A closer look at Dueck's theory, however, suggests that his pessimism may be unwarranted even  in his own terms. Moderate liberal internationalism -- a blend of realist prudence with measured,  steady support for international institutions and democracy abroad -- is perfectly compatible  with American strategic culture as he describes it. (In fact, it is what even some former neoconservatives,  such as Fukuyama, now recommend.) Dueck himself suggests that the best U.S. policy in 1919 would  have been to join the League of Nations but without accepting an unconditional commitment to fight  any aggressor, while simultaneously forming an alliance with the other two great liberal democratic  powers, France and the United Kingdom. This pragmatic yet liberal option was shunned, Dueck writes,  not because it was inherently unacceptable to U.S. culture but because of Wilson's arbitrary,  polarizing way of framing the issue. Bush made a similar mistake. Using multilateral pressure  to neutralize the threat from Saddam Hussein was not unworkable strategically or culturally;  the option was simply pushed aside by the White House in favor of nearly unilateral preventive war.</p>
<p>In fact, a key reason why the United States won the Cold War at a reasonable price (apart from its  unfortunate detour into Vietnam) was its cost-conscious, moderately liberal, realism-informed  grand strategy. Washington relied on the country's tremendous military and economic power, the  attractiveness of its society and political institutions, and its strategic restraint to attract  allies and institutionalize cooperation among them. Postwar U.S. leaders resisted reckless  calls to roll back the Red Army in Eastern Europe or to launch a preventive war against the rising  Soviet military threat. U.S. forces were generally welcomed when they acted as liberators, not  marauders. In 1956, the United States stood on the right side of history at Suez when it slammed the  door on colonialism. It put its power at the service of international institutions that have helped  to reconcile open world markets with economic and political stability. It presided over an international  system where many more states have become democratic. Most countries sided with the United States  because its liberal world system worked -- and worked for them.</p>
<p>Even the U.S. instinct for limited liability is, on balance, an asset. The cost-consciousness  of voters (who pay the price of reckless policies) echoes classical realists' call for prudence.  Democracies are smarter than autocracies when it comes to picking the wars they choose to start;  they win over 90 percent of them, and with fewer casualties. This is not simply because democracies  are stronger, but also because their voters care about costs, have access to information and expert  analysis, and can hold their leaders accountable for mistakes. Democratic empires sometimes  blunder into overextension, but in comparison to autocratic ones, they are much quicker to retrench  after failures. When the German and Japanese empires got overextended, they tried to solve the  problem by attacking on an even wider scale; when the British and the Americans blundered into quagmires  in the Boer War and the Vietnam War, respectively, they cut their losses.</p>
<p>Dueck is right, however, that the United States has not always struck a perfect balance between  its liberal ambitions and the resources needed to realize them. One recurrent problem is that the  United States sometimes makes hollow promises to protect a vulnerable minority -- such as the  Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica, the Kosovar Albanians, the Rwandan Tutsi, or the people of Darfur.  This sometimes goads tyrannical majorities into accelerating ethnic cleansing so as to prevent  a troublesome minority from linking up with its supporters in the West. Even when U.S. promises  to vulnerable groups are not hollow, the aid sometimes arrives too late. The problem is not just  the American instinct to limit liability, but Washington's tendency to conduct overly ambitious  diplomacy, such as when the White House took an uncompromising position against Serbia at the Rambouillet  talks. The humanitarian impulse is not wrong, but it needs to be administered with a strong dose  of realism.</p>
<p>The second recurrent problem that results from U.S. political culture is the temptation to  embark on ideological crusades. This temptation is not in fact inherent to liberal internationalism;  it is a perversion of it. Dueck's historical analysis shows that the main danger in the U.S. system  is that it allows an ideologically polarizing leader to capitalize on external threats -- whether  real or imagined -- to frame questions of grand strategy in terms of a liberal crusade. Fortunately,  although U.S. political culture makes this outcome possible, it also provides the means necessary  to expose such visions as strategically unsound and, in fact, illiberal. The solution is not to  give up on the liberal strategic culture that has generally served the United States and the world  well. It is, rather, to remain vigilant against attempts to exploit fear in order to hijack U.S.  foreign policy in the service of a strategy that is neither liberal  nor realistic.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1069916/ajax/content?token=uN_K6aVuXxFr7Hjnm8V2XxJWP3m9YnvOSwy61FaTtMU" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
