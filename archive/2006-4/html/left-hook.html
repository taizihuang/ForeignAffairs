<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs has recently published three essays that sought to explain Latin America's  leftward shift. Let me offer another explanation: over the last 25 years, Latin America has experienced  a disastrous economic failure. From 1960 to 1980, the region's real per capita income grew by 82  percent; from 1980 to 2000, it grew by only 9 percent; and in the last five years, it grew by just 4 percent.</p>
<p>It is thus not surprising that winning presidential candidates in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,  Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela have all campaigned against the neoliberal reforms of the past  quarter century. Since these reforms were backed by Washington, sometimes with considerable  pressure, it should not be surprising that anti-Americanism has accompanied the voters' rebellion.</p>
<p>To support their Cold War perspective, the writers present a particularly distorted picture  of Venezuela. Michael Shifter ("In Search of Hugo Chávez," May/June 2006) writes of "credible  anecdotal evidence of the existence of lists of individuals' votes that have been used to deny Chávez's  opponents jobs and services." There are no such lists. Voting is by secret ballot, and there is no  evidence that this secrecy has been violated -- international election observers have said  as much. Peter Hakim's claim that "Venezuela today barely qualifies as a democracy" ("Is Washington  Losing Latin America?" January/February 2006) would also surprise nonpartisan observers: by  the criteria he is using -- whatever they may be -- few if any countries in the region could be  called democracies.</p>

</div><p>Jorge Castañeda ("Latin America's Left Turn," May/June 2006) goes to further extremes  to misrepresent Venezuela's economic performance under Chávez. Castañeda lops  off the last two years (when the country's GDP grew by a total of 28 percent) and includes two years  before Chávez took office in presenting data on Venezuela's economic growth. He also distorts  the poverty numbers (as does Shifter), concluding that "Chávez does very little for the  poor of his own country" -- an absurd claim that even many of Chávez's harshest opponents  have abandoned.</p>
<p>Castañeda distinguishes between what he calls a "right left" and a "wrong left." But it  is the "wrong left" that is delivering on its promises: Argentina's rapid growth under President  Néstor Kirchner (three years of increases of more than 9 percent of GDP) has pulled six million  people above the poverty line. And Kirchner has pursued unorthodox economic policies (for example,  on exchange rates and monetary policy) and confronted powerful interests, including foreign  creditors and the International Monetary Fund. Chávez has infuriated Washington and  Venezuela's upper classes but has reversed the country's long-term economic decline and brought  free health care and subsidized food to its poor. By contrast, Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio  Lula da Silva, whom Castañeda places on the "right left," gets rave reviews from international  media and the international elite for sticking to the policies of his predecessor (including maintaining  extremely high interest rates and an overvalued currency), but the results have been sluggish  growth and little improvement for Brazil's poor.</p>
<p>Maybe we should all show a little more respect for democracy in Latin America and start asking  what has caused the unprecedented 25-year economic failure that is prompting voters there to look  for new ways to make capitalism work.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1068546/ajax/content?token=GLSfnirkKN4NRZ9ECt2Q91GUxpP_M6ypIwhdOx0_Jvs" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
