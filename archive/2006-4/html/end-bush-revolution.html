<p>Reading over President George W. Bush's March 2006 National Security Strategy,  one would be hard-pressed to find much evidence that the president has backed away from what has  become known as the Bush doctrine. "America is at war," says the document; we will "fight our enemies  abroad instead of waiting for them to arrive in our country" and "support democratic movements  and institutions in every nation and culture," with the ultimate goal of "ending tyranny in our  world."</p>
<p>Talk to any senior administration official, and he or she will tell you  that the president is as committed as ever to the "revolutionary" foreign policy principles he  spelled out after 9/11: the United States is fighting a war on terror and must remain on the offensive  and ready to act alone, U.S. power is the foundation of global order, and the spread of democracy  and freedom is the key to a safer and more peaceful world. Bush reiterated such thinking in his 2006  State of the Union address, insisting that the United States will "act boldly in freedom's cause"  and "never surrender to evil."</p>
<p>But if the rhetoric of the Bush revolution lives on, the revolution itself  is over. The question is not whether the president and most of his team still hold to the basic tenets  of the Bush doctrine -- they do -- but whether they can sustain it. They cannot. Although the  administration does not like to admit it, U.S. foreign policy is already on a very different trajectory  than it was in Bush's first term. The budgetary, political, and diplomatic realities that the first  Bush team tried to ignore have begun to set in.</p>
<p>The reversal of the Bush revolution is a good thing. By overreaching  in Iraq, alienating important allies, and allowing the war on terrorism to overshadow all other  national priorities, Bush has gotten the United States bogged down in an unsuccessful war, overstretched  the military, and broken the domestic bank. Washington now lacks the reservoir of international  legitimacy, resources, and domestic support necessary to pursue other key national interests.</p>

</div><p>It is not too late to put U.S. foreign policy back on a more sustainable  course, and Bush has already begun to do so. But these new, mostly positive trends are no less reversible  than the old ones were. Another terrorist attack on the United States, a major challenge from Iran,  or a fresh burst of misplaced optimism about Iraq could entice the administration to return to its  revolutionary course -- with potentially disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>THE ACCIDENTAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>It is no small irony that Bush's foreign policy ended up on the idealistic  end of the U.S. foreign policy spectrum. Contrary to the notion, common on the left and overseas,  that the Bush team was hawkish and interventionist from the start, the administration was in fact  deeply divided in its first months. If anything, it leaned toward the realist view that the United  States should avoid meddling in the domestic affairs of other nations. In his campaign, Bush famously  called for a "humble" foreign policy, meant to contrast with the interventionism of Bill Clinton's  presidency, and promised to focus on "enduring national interests" rather than idealistic humanitarian  goals. Candidate Bush warned against the notion that "our military is the answer to every difficult  foreign policy situation -- a substitute for strategy."</p>
<p>To be sure, the administration included major players from the neoconservative  camp -- including Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Undersecretary of Defense Douglas  Feith, and Undersecretary of State John Bolton -- who believed in the forceful promotion of democracy  in other countries. But the more central players appeared to be closer to the realism of Bush's father.  Vice President Dick Cheney, a key player in the George H. W. Bush administration, had opposed using  U.S. forces to overthrow Saddam Hussein during the first Gulf War ("How long would we have had to  stay in Baghdad?") and had lobbied against sanctions on Iran as CEO of Halliburton in the late 1990s.  Secretary of State Colin Powell was famously cautious about the use of force to pursue foreign policy  goals and emphasized the value of allies. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice -- who  insisted that the role of the 82nd Airborne was not to "escort kids to kindergarten" -- was a protégé  of the realist icon Brent Scowcroft. In her Republican Party foreign policy manifesto, published  in Foreign Affairs in January/February 2000, Rice wrote that regimes such as those in Iraq and North  Korea were "living on borrowed time, so there need be no sense of panic about them." She called for  the first line of defense to be "a clear and classical statement of deterrence -- if they do acquire  WMD [weapons of mass destruction], their weapons will be unusable because any attempt to use them  will bring national obliteration." Powell had also questioned whether Iraq posed a serious threat  and had suggested in his January 2001 confirmation hearings that U.S. policy would be to "keep [the  Iraqis] in the rather broken condition they are in now."</p>
<p>How, then, did the United States go from this cautious realism to the  invasion of Iraq and a foreign policy focused on ending tyranny throughout the world? The answer  is to be found in the unique combination of two factors.</p>
<p>The first was the sudden sense of vulnerability Americans felt following  9/11. The attacks profoundly altered the American worldview -- not only because they took place  on U.S. soil, but also because of Americans' low tolerance, born of their country's relatively  blessed history, for insecurity. Not since the Cuban missile crisis had Americans felt anything  remotely as threatening to their homeland as this, which made the public highly receptive to calls  to "do something" about terrorism. When anthrax attacks killed five Americans and terrorized  the general population later that fall, many concluded that only a dramatic change in U.S. foreign  policy -- even if it meant military action to transform the world, starting with the Middle East -- could  make the homeland safe again. Europeans and others might be resigned to living with the dangers  of terrorism, but Americans, so long protected by oceans and friendly neighbors, were not.</p>
<p>The second factor that led to the revolution in U.S. foreign policy was  a feeling of tremendous power. It may have been a sense of vulnerability that convinced Americans  that they had to do something to transform the world, but it was a sense of unprecedented power that  convinced them that they could. After the preoccupation with national "decline" in the deficit-ridden  late 1980s, a decade of fantastic economic growth, technological progress, and military successes  led Americans to conclude by 2001 that transformation was possible, if only the country's leaders  committed to that goal. Naysayers at home and abroad might warn about overreach, but that was because  they did not appreciate what a determined United States could accomplish. (A similar feeling of  power has been a determining factor in all instances of an activist U.S. foreign policy since World  War II: economic growth under presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and Clinton  tended to push the United States toward confidence and expansionism, whereas concerns about deficits  and stagnation sent it in the opposite direction under Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and George  H. W. Bush.)</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>The combination of these two factors -- a feeling of vulnerability  and a feeling of power -- tipped the balance within the administration in favor of the idealists  and put the president and the vice president firmly in that camp. Gone was the aversion to interventionism  and gone was caution; in their place was an unwavering determination to make the homeland safe,  first by using U.S. military power to eliminate threats such as Saddam Hussein and then by spreading  freedom and democracy around the world.</p>
<p>Whether Washington's European allies, or anyone else, for that matter,  accepted the administration's logic was thought largely immaterial. According to the administration,  success in Iraq, which few top officials doubted, would have a positive spillover effect elsewhere  in the Middle East, at which point U.S. allies would start to come on board. U.S. leadership, the  thinking went, consisted not of endlessly consulting pessimistic allies to see what they had to  say, but of setting out a bold course, decisively following it, and winning over allies through  victory rather than persuasion.</p>
<p>REVOLUTION MEETS REALITY</p>
<p>Needless to say, everything has not turned out as planned. Far from producing  the rapid liberation, stabilization, and democratization of Iraq, the U.S. invasion has led to  a protracted insurgency, significant Iraqi civilian and U.S. military casualties, and a high  risk of civil war. At the time of the fall of Baghdad, in the spring of 2003, polls showed that more  than 70 percent of Americans supported the war; by early 2006, polls indicated that a majority had  concluded that the war was a mistake. The allied support that success was supposed to bring also  failed to materialize. The absence of the WMD that had provided the official pretext for the war -- and  the widespread impression that the administration had exaggerated the threat in order to sell  the war and had violated international law by waging it -- raised serious questions about the  legitimacy of U.S. foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The consequences of the war in Iraq -- and of other U.S. policies on  issues ranging from the Middle East to climate change, prisoner treatment, and the International  Criminal Court (ICC) -- have taken their toll on the United States' popularity in the world and  thus on its ability to win over allies. Far from producing the expected "bandwagoning," the exercise  of unilateral U.S. power has led to widespread hostility toward the Bush administration and, in  many cases, the United States itself. According to the Pew Global Attitudes Project, between 2002  and 2005 the percentage of people with a "favorable opinion" of the United States fell from 72 percent  to 59 percent in Canada, 63 percent to 43 percent in France, 61 percent to 41 percent in Germany, 61  percent to 38 percent in Indonesia, 25 percent to 21 percent in Jordan, 79 percent to 62 percent in  Poland, 61 percent to 52 percent in Russia, 30 percent to 23 percent in Turkey, and 75 percent to 55  percent in the United Kingdom. According to the same polls, the percentage of those who believed  that the United States took their country's interests into account was 19 percent in Canada, 18  percent in France, 38 percent in Germany, 59 percent in Indonesia, 17 percent in Jordan, 20 percent  in the Netherlands, 13 percent in Poland, 21 percent in Russia, 19 percent in Spain, 14 percent in  Turkey, and 32 percent in the United Kingdom. Global support for U.S. policies has never been a prerequisite  for U.S. activism, but it sure does not hurt.</p>
<p>On top of failure in Iraq and a decline in legitimacy and popularity abroad,  the feeling and the reality of U.S. power needed for a foreign policy of transforming the world have  also been evaporating. When Bush took office in 2001, he inherited an annual budgetary surplus of  over $200 billion and many additional years' worth of projected surpluses. Under those circumstances,  it was not surprising that Americans regained confidence in their ability to change the world for  the better, even if that meant supporting military interventions abroad and vastly expanding  the defense budget. But after the terrorist attacks, a recession, two wars, and several massive  tax cuts, the sense that the United States can afford "whatever it takes" is gone. By the start of 2006,  the $200 billion annual surplus had turned into a more than $400 billion annual deficit, and the  national debt that Washington had started paying off in 1999 was up to more than $8 trillion and was  rising.</p>
<p>Domestic support for the administration -- another prerequisite  for a revolutionary foreign policy in a democracy -- is also on the wane. After a slew of scandals,  bad news from Iraq, and the poor handling of Hurricane Katrina and of the controversy over Dubai  Ports World's managing U.S. ports, Bush's approval rating has fallen to under 35 percent and Cheney's  to just 20 percent. By early 2006, 55 percent of Americans surveyed said that the invasion of Iraq  had not been "worth it," and more Americans thought the United States should "mind [its] own business"  than at any time since Vietnam. In a 2006 Public Agenda poll, only 20 percent of respondents agreed  that spreading democracy to other countries was a "very important goal" for U.S. foreign policy,  representing the lowest support for any goal asked about in the survey. A blind spot in the neoconservative  case for democracy promotion and unilateral military action has always been that it overlooks  the limits on the American public's willingness to tolerate the costs.</p>
<p>These developments have inevitably had a major impact on the administration's  ability to pursue the transformative foreign policy that was its hallmark in Bush's first term.  Although the president's rhetoric and core beliefs may not have changed, the realities of a difficult  world are clearly sinking in.</p>
<p>THE COUNTERREVOLUTION</p>

</div>
</div><p>The modified approach to foreign policy was immediately apparent in  the new tone and style adopted at the start of Bush's second term. Newly appointed Secretary of State  Rice stated in her confirmation hearing that "the time for diplomacy is now" and immediately set  off on a fence-mending trip to Europe, where the costs of U.S. unilateralism had become most apparent.  A few weeks later, the president himself went to Europe, where he reached out to allies in a way that  sharply contrasted with the unilateralism of his first term. On Bush's first two trips to Europe  in the summer of 2001, he made visits to Poland, Spain (then still led by the pro-American José  Marìa Aznar), the United Kingdom, and Italy, signaling that the United States would work  closely with its friends but snub its critics. On his 2005 trip, he spent a full day visiting the headquarters  of NATO and the European Union, in Brussels, and had long meetings with French President Jacques  Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. Rice's travel schedule also indicated a  greater effort to reach out to allies than that of the supposedly multilateralist Powell did. In  her first year as secretary of state, Rice took 19 trips to 49 countries, compared with Powell's  12 trips to 37 countries in his first year. Nearly 7o percent of Rice's time abroad in 2005 was spent  in Europe.</p>
<p>The new tone and style was also reflected in the foreign policy team Bush  and Rice put together. The president, the vice president, and the secretary of defense were obviously  still in place and in charge, but many of those most closely associated with the ideology of the first  term were not. Gone from the halls of power were the neoconservatives Wolfowitz, Feith, and Bolton  (the last was sent to the United Nations, an important post but not a policymaking job). The new team  instead featured pragmatists such as Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, Undersecretary  of State Nicholas Burns, and North Korea negotiator Christopher Hill.</p>
<p>What is more important than the new tone or new personnel, policies have  also started to shift during the Bush administration's second term. After criticizing European  engagement with Iran for years and insisting that the United States would not "reward bad behavior,"  the president returned from his February 2005 trip and announced that the United States would support  the "EU-3" negotiations being conducted by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom and even throw  some of its own "carrots" -- airplane spare parts and support for World Trade Organization accession  negotiations -- into the mix. When, in late 2005, Iran threatened to break off negotiations with  the Europeans and resume nuclear enrichment, the United States insisted there was plenty of time  to take the issue to the UN Security Council, leaving some of its European partners wondering if  it was going "wobbly." In March 2006, the administration announced that it had offered to open up  a dialogue with Tehran about Iraq, a dramatic departure from its earlier insistence that such a  step would legitimize the Iranian regime, and it bowed to Russia's refusal to accept anything stronger  than a critical "presidential statement" when the nuclear issue was reported to the Security Council.  Bush's declaration, in his 2006 State of the Union speech, that the United States would "continue  to rally the world" to confront the Iranian threat was a far cry from earlier suggestions of how the  United States might deal with a charter member of "the axis of evil."</p>
<p>There was also a significant change in policy toward the other outstanding  member of that club, North Korea. Having denounced the Clinton administration's 1994 Agreed Framework  and having insisted it would never agree to anything similar, the Bush administration accepted  an arrangement with Pyongyang in September 2005 that would have provided North Korea with energy  aid, security guarantees, and the gradual normalization of relations in exchange for North Korea's  abandoning its nuclear weapons programs. Such an agreement could almost certainly have been reached  years before, but it was anathema to the first Bush team. Although the September 2005 deal has effectively  collapsed, it is telling that the Bush administration was willing to reach it in the first place.</p>
<p>The second Bush team has also made modest changes in its stances on foreign  aid and climate change, in an effort to reverse the United States' negative image in the world. In  the run-up to the G-8 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, Bush announced his intention to double U.S.  aid to Africa by 2010 and to commit $1.2 billion for a five-year plan to combat malaria in sub-Saharan  Africa. At the summit itself, Bush acknowledged that global climate change was a "serious, urgent,  and largely man-made problem" and agreed to join other countries in discussions of what to do about  it. Critics naturally wanted the administration to go much further on both issues, but there is  no doubt that Bush was at least trying to take a step in the direction of world opinion -- something  that the administration in his first term had deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>The new Bush team has even modified its stance toward certain international  organizations. In Bush's first term, the administration displayed unmitigated hostility toward  the ICC -- to the point of cutting off financial aid to anyone, even key allies, who refused to grant  U.S. citizens a blanket exemption from its provisions. During Bush's second term, in contrast,  the administration has supported a UN resolution that would refer war crimes suspects from Sudan's  Darfur region to the ICC and has agreed to the use of ICC facilities in The Hague for the war crimes  trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor. In February 2006, Bush pledged support  for a UN mission to help end the killing in Darfur, something the administration resisted throughout  its first term. And when, in March 2006, UN members agreed to set up a Human Rights Council (to replace  the UN Commission on Human Rights) that was not to Washington's liking, the administration did  not vote for it but at the same time pledged to support it and work with it -- instead of delegitimizing  it, as Washington initially had the ICC.</p>
<p>Finally, the administration has shown signs of backing away from a core  tenet of the foreign policy of its first term by deciding, in the summer of 2005, that the "global  war on terror" (GWOT) would henceforth be known as the "global struggle against violent extremism"  (gsave). The president himself let it be known that he still believed the United States was fighting  a "war" and repudiated the new rhetoric, but the fact that the administration was even pondering  such a change -- and that even Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was using the new language -- was  a sure sign that it had acknowledged some of the excesses of Bush's first term. The administration  now goes out of its way to emphasize that it knows it is in a "generational" struggle and that it must  do more to win global hearts, minds, and sympathy -- a task recently put under the control of one  of Bush's most trusted advisers, Karen Hughes.</p>
<p>THE RISK OF RELAPSE</p>
<p>The stalling of the Bush revolution is not really surprising. U.S. foreign  policy has historically been marked by regular and sometimes wild swings between internationalism  and isolationism, and those swings have been influenced by changes in threat perceptions, the  amount of available resources, and the level of domestic political support, just as they are today.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Accordingly, the new direction of Bush's foreign policy is far from  irreversible. Although the Bush team has been forced by reality to work more closely with allies  and to set aside the doctrine of regime change by military intervention, many in the administration  still believe that the threat of terrorism allows -- or even requires -- the United States to  operate under different international rules from everyone else, limiting the degree to which the  administration can continue to adapt. Moreover, powerful figures within the administration -- not  least the vice president -- will continue to argue against the new pragmatism. Indeed, part of  the "revolutionary" premise of the foreign policy of Bush's first term was the notion, harking  back to the Reagan administration, that determination, optimism, and U.S. power would eventually  prevail, regardless of what Democrats and foreign critics might assert. It is a convenient thesis,  but one that does not allow for self-correction; it paints any lack of domestic or international  support as a badge of honor and apparent failures as only temporary setbacks rather than as reasons  to change course.</p>
<p>What could cause Bush to reconsider his new approach and put U.S. foreign  policy back on a more revolutionary path? Certainly, another major terrorist attack on the United  States, which remains possible, could do so. If a U.S. city were hit by a chemical or biological terrorist  attack leading to mass casualties, more Americans might come around to the view that the United  States is in fact "at war" and that the administration's aggressive efforts to "change the world"  are "worth it." Bombing Iran in order to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons would probably  seem rash and counterproductive to most Americans today, but in the wake of a nuclear or even a "dirty  bomb" attack that killed large numbers of Americans, the calculation about the risks of nuclear  proliferation might look very different. A WMD attack might even provide retrospective justification  for the Iraq war, reinforcing the notion that the United States cannot risk not acting in the face  of a potential threat of proliferation.</p>
<p>Even in the absence of another terrorist attack, Iran -- which the  new National Security Strategy says poses the greatest challenge to the United States of any single  country -- could provoke a reversion to the original Bush doctrine. For the past two years, the  trend in the administration has been to emphasize diplomacy and international consensus, the  opposite of the approach that characterized the administration's Iraq policy in 2002-3. But if  that approach manifestly fails -- for example, if evidence emerges that Iran is actually closer  to a nuclear weapons capability than previously thought -- Bush may be faced sooner rather than  later with a choice between acquiescing to a nuclear Iran or resorting to the unilateral use of force.  For now, the administration's clear preference is to avoid a confrontation and keep the international  community on its side. But what if that requires direct engagement with the radical regime of President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and an end to U.S. efforts to promote regime change? That might be a bridge too  far for this team, and Bush might conclude that military force -- or accelerated efforts to destabilize  the Iranian regime -- is the only way to uphold his 2002 State of the Union pledge not to allow "the  world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."</p>
<p>Finally, it is always possible that new developments will be taken as  evidence that the Bush doctrine has actually been working. For example, the formation of a viable  Iraqi government followed by an ebbing of the insurgency and progress toward democratization  elsewhere in the Middle East could lead the administration back in the direction of foreign policy  assertiveness. After all, it was not that long ago that successful elections in Iraq and Afghanistan,  a revolution in Lebanon followed by Syrian withdrawal, nuclear disarmament in Libya, and steps  toward democracy elsewhere in the Arab world were leading administration enthusiasts to crow  about their success; even some skeptical observers were concluding that Bush might actually be  right. Renewed progress in these areas, especially if it allows for a military withdrawal from  Iraq and coincides with a burst of growth in the U.S. economy, could give new force to the idea that  a determined United States can transform the world and new arguments to those who believe that Bush  should not waver in the promotion of his doctrine.</p>
<p>The more likely course is that global realities and resource constraints  will continue to force the administration toward pragmatism, modesty, and cooperation with allies.  Even serious new challenges and threats would be unlikely to persuade chastened Americans to get  back on board for the types of policies they have been coming to doubt; the scenario whereby dictatorships  start falling like dominoes and the United States feels rich, powerful, and right is highly desirable  but unlikely to unfold anytime soon.</p>
<p>Still, it would be rash to exclude a return to a more radical approach,  especially from a president who believes he is on a mission and who has time and again proved willing  to take massive risks and surprise his critics. If such a return happens, brace yourself -- because  there is no reason to believe that round two of the Bush revolution would be more successful than  round one. Indeed, without the resources, international legitimacy, and degree of political  support Bush had the first time around, it might be considerably worse.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110409/ajax/content?token=3B3Ayrg4Nb6vn9wqo8Mt2NBnWUCoufyUckjuNktcdIU" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
