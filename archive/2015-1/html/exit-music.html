<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p class="p1">I<span class="s1">n describing what he characterizes as </span>a bungled U.S. exit from Iraq, Rick Brennan (“<a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/142204/rick-brennan/withdrawal-symptoms" target="_blank"><strong>Withdrawal Symptoms</strong></a>,” November/December 2014) presents an incomplete picture. For one thing, he <span class="s1">overestimates the desire among Iraq’s leaders for U.S. forces to stay in the country past 2011, the date by which </span>Iraq and the United States agreed that the U.S. military presence would end. When U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq’s <span class="s1">major population centers in 2009, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki </span><span class="s1">announced triumphantly that his country </span><span class="s1">had finally “repelled the invaders.” It’s true that Maliki sent mixed signals at times and that he might have exaggerated his opposition to the presence </span><span class="s1">of U.S. forces for the benefit of domestic </span><span class="s1">audiences. But the Iraqi parliament consistently opposed Washington’s </span><span class="s1">insistence that it grant legal immunity </span><span class="s1">from Iraqi law to U.S. troops who stayed past 2011. Members of parliament knew </span><span class="s1">their refusal to do so would doom any agreement on allowing U.S. troops to </span><span class="s1">remain longer. Their public stance on </span><span class="s1">this issue, and not Maliki’s alleged flex-ibility in private, is the single best gauge </span><span class="s1">of the Iraqi elite’s attitude toward </span>the prospect of an extended U.S. military presence.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Brennan argues that a lasting American presence would have bolstered Iraq’s </span><span class="s1">fledgling security forces. As evidence, </span><span class="s1">he cites a 2010 internal review by U.S. </span><span class="s1">military planners that concluded that if U.S. troops withdrew completely by 2011, Iraq’s security forces would be unable to defend the country. But Brennan ignores public statements </span><span class="s1">made by David Petraeus and Raymond Odierno, two of the last U.S. military commanders in Iraq. In 2008, Petraeus told Congress that the performance of many Iraqi units was “solid.” Odierno, in media appearances in June 2009, went even further, claiming that Iraq’s military was ready to stand on its own. And in 2013, Petraeus wrote in <i>Foreign Policy</i> </span><span class="s1">that Iraqi forces had capably taken charge </span><span class="s1">of the country’s security by the time U.S. troops left in 2011.</span></p>
<p class="p3">In reality, the Iraqi army, like Iraq itself, unraveled not because of a lack of U.S. training or support but because of Maliki’s intransigence and methodical pursuit of sectarian interests. As Bren<span class="s1">nan acknowledges, Maliki gutted the </span>Iraqi army’s officer corps, systematically replacing competent Sunni officers he <span class="s1">mistrusted with incompetent Shiite </span>ones he considered loyal. Maliki took a similar approach with the civil service, <span class="s1">further marginalizing the country’s </span>Sunni majority and Kurdish population. </p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Despite Brennan’s claims, there is no evi</span><span class="s1">dence that a residual U.S. military presence would have reined in Maliki’s </span><span class="s1">sectarianism. As Brennan himself admits</span><span class="s1">, Maliki “failed to take any serious actions </span><span class="s1">leading toward genuine Shiite-Sunni </span><span class="s1">reconciliation.” For example, even during </span>the temporary “surge” of U.S. forces <span class="s1">beginning in 2007, when the United States had more than 100,000 troops on </span>the ground in Iraq, and despite applying <span class="s1">heavy pressure, U.S. officials failed to persuade Maliki to act on an arrest warrant for Lieutenant General Mahdi al-Gharawi, a Maliki ally who had been </span><span class="s1">charged with running secret prisons </span>and <span class="s1">torturing detainees. Instead, Maliki </span><span class="s1">promoted Gharawi, placing him in charge </span><span class="s1">of Nineveh Province, where the strategically crucial city of Mosul is located. In June 2014, Gharawi abandoned his post </span><span class="s1">when the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, or ISIS, attacked the city.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When I met with Maliki in 2011, I asked him if there was anything more </span><span class="s1">that U.S. President Barack Obama could </span><span class="s1">have done to make it possible for a residual </span>U.S. force to stay in Iraq. He answered no. If anyone jeopardized Iraq’s future, it was Maliki.</p>

</div><p class="p4"><em><span class="s1">LAWRENCE J. KORB<b> </b></span><span class="s1">is a Senior Fellow at the </span><span class="s1">Center for American Progress. From 1981 to 1985</span><span class="s1">, he served as U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense.</span></em></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">BRENNAN REPLIES:</span></p>
<p class="p1">L<span class="s1">awrence Korb is correct that </span>Nouri al-Maliki’s policies aggravated sectarian divisions in Iraq <span class="s1">and contributed to the poor performance of the Iraqi military. But on a number of </span>other points, he is wrong.</p>
<p class="p3">First, Korb suggests that public statements by two U.S. generals, David Petraeus and Raymond Odierno, undermine my argument. But Petraeus and Odierno never asserted that the Iraqi military was capable of defending the <span class="s1">country on its own. In April 2008, Petraeus did tell Congress that the </span><span class="s1">performance of many Iraqi military units </span>was “solid.” But in the same testimony, <span class="s1">he also stated that Iraqi forces were “not </span><span class="s1">yet ready to defend Iraq or maintain </span><span class="s1">security throughout the country on their </span>own.” In June 2009, Odierno told CNN <span class="s1">that Iraqi forces were ready to take </span><span class="s1">responsibility </span>for conducting independent operations in major metropolitan areas, but he did not say that they could <span class="s1">operate entirely without U.S. assistance</span>. And in his 2013 essay for <i>Foreign Policy</i>, Petraeus noted only that Baghdad had “achieved slow but steady progress in <span class="s1">building the capabilities of the Iraqi </span>Security Forces” during the surge and <span class="s1">that the Iraqi military had gradually </span>assumed responsibility for the country’s security by 2011—not that Iraqi forces <span class="s1">were prepared to succeed without U.S. support.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Moreover, from 2009 to 2011, the U.S. </span><span class="s1">military continued to help Iraqi forces with training, logistics, maintenance, </span>intelligence, and air support. Although <span class="s1">U.S. military officials publicly applauded </span><span class="s1">the capabilities of Iraqi troops, U.S. </span>forces were always there to ensure that they didn’t fail. This “enabling support,” as U.S. officials called it, was available <span class="s1">every day, at every level of command, in every Iraqi province, until the American withdrawal.</span></p>
<p class="p3">Second, Korb argues that the Iraqi <span class="s1">parliament did not want a residual U.S. </span><span class="s1">military presence in Iraq. This is an oversimplification. In October 2011, </span>every member of parliament, with the exception of 40 members of a hard-line <span class="s1">Shiite Islamist party, voted in favor of </span><span class="s1">a </span><span class="s1">continued U.S. troop presence—a </span>position overwhelmingly supported by <span class="s1">the Iraqi military. Due to domestic </span>political considerations, however, only <span class="s1">Kurdish parliamentarians were willing to </span><span class="s1">take the political risk of publicly backing </span><span class="s1">legal immunity for U.S. troops who stayed past 2011. The outcome might have been different had the Obama </span>administration either started the negotiations <span class="s1">earlier or been more willing to compromise. </span></p>
<p class="p3">Third, Korb claims that a continued U.S. military presence would not have <span class="s1">curbed Maliki’s sectarianism. It’s true that Maliki often ignored Washington’s wishes even when U.S. troops were present, but </span><span class="s1">the United States frequently moderated Maliki’s most extreme sectarian tendencies. For example, Maliki refrained from </span>issuing an arrest warrant for a key political rival, Iraqi Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, until the day after U.S. military forces departed the country.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p class="p3"><span class="s1">Korb is right on one important count: Maliki holds a great deal of responsibility for jeopardizing Iraq’s future. But the Obama administration is also at fault—for failing to develop a coherent strategy to protect U.S. interests in Iraq and the region by safeguarding the hard-fought gains made during the eight years that U.S. forces spent in Iraq.</span></p>
