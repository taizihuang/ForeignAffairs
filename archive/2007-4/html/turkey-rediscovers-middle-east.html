<p>While the recent wrangling in Turkey between the  generals and the Islamists has drawn attention to Turkey's domestic policies, a  significant shift in the country's foreign policy has gone largely unnoticed: after  decades of passivity, Turkey is now emerging as an important diplomatic actor in  the Middle East. Over the past few years, Ankara has established close ties with  Iran and Syria, with which it had tense relations during the 1980s and 1990s; adopted  a more active approach toward the Palestinians' grievances; and improved relations  with the Arab world more broadly.</p>
<p>This new activism is an important departure  from recent Turkish foreign policy. One of the basic principles espoused by Mustafa  Kemal (better known as Atatürk), the founder of the modern Turkish republic,  was that Turkey should limit its involvement in Middle Eastern affairs, and except  for a brief period in the 1950s, Ankara largely stuck to it.</p>
<p>Turkey's recent focus on the Middle  East, however, does not mean that Turkey is about to turn its back on the West.  Nor is the shift evidence of the "creeping Islamization" of Turkish foreign policy,  as some critics claim. Turkey's new activism is a response to structural changes  in its security environment since the end of the Cold War. And, if managed properly,  it could be an opportunity for Washington and its Western allies to use Turkey as  a bridge to the Middle East.</p>
<p>CASUALTIES OF WAR</p>

</div><p>During the Cold War, the main threats to Turkish  security came almost exclusively from the Soviet Union. Today, Turkey faces a much  more diverse set of challenges: growing Kurdish separatism, sectarian violence in  Iraq that could spill over, the rise of Iran, and the fragmentation of Lebanon,  partly at the hands of radical groups with close ties to Syria and Iran. Since most  of these come from Turkey's southern periphery and the wider Middle East, Turkey  has understandably begun to focus more attention on the region.</p>
<p>At the same time, Turkey's ties to the West  have deteriorated. Its path to European Union membership has been blocked by disagreements  with Brussels over Cyprus and over stalled political and economic reforms in Turkey,  as well as by rising concern among Europeans about immigration, unemployment, and  eu enlargement. In addition, Turkey's relations with the United States have become  increasingly strained, largely because of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. According to  a poll conducted by the German Marshall Fund in September 2006, 81 percent of Turks  disapproved (and only seven percent approved) of President George W. Bush's handling  of international policies. Turkey is now in the unprecedented situation of having  poor relations with the eu and the United States simultaneously.</p>
<p>These trends have coincided with -- and  to some extent been reinforced by -- important domestic changes in Turkish society.  The pro-Western elite that has shaped Turkish foreign policy since the end of World  War II is gradually being replaced by a more conservative, more religious, and more  nationalist elite that is suspicious of the West and has a more positive attitude  toward Turkey's Ottoman past. The ruling Islamist Justice and Development Party  (known as the akp), headed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has managed to  tap into rising popular nationalism by fusing it with Islam.</p>
<p>The Gulf War in 1990-91 was a critical  catalyst for Turkey's reentry into the Middle East. Against the advice of many of  his advisers and of the Turkish military, President Turgut Özal threw Turkey's  full support behind the U.S. military campaign to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. He enforced  United Nations sanctions by cutting off the flow of Iraq's oil exports through Turkish  pipelines, deployed 100,000 troops along the Iraqi-Turkish border, and allowed the  United States to fly sorties into Iraq from Turkish bases. Özal saw the war  as an opportunity to demonstrate Turkey's continued strategic importance and cement  closer defense ties with the United States. He hoped that Turkey's support would  strengthen its "strategic partnership" with the United States and enhance its prospects  of joining the European Community (as the eu was then called).</p>
<p>Özal's hopes proved illusory on  both counts. The strategic partnership with the United States never materialized,  and Turkey's chances at membership in the European Community hardly improved. Economically,  Turkey paid a high price for its support of the U.S. military campaign: it lost  billions of dollars in pipeline fees and trade. Politically, it was left facing  a major escalation of its Kurdish problem. The establishment of a de facto Kurdish  state in northern Iraq under Western protection gave new impetus to Kurdish nationalism  and provided a logistical base for attacks on Turkish territory by the Kurdistan  Workers' Party, the violent Kurdish separatist group known as the pkk. For many  Turks, the war was, as the veteran Turkey watcher Ian Lesser has noted, "the place  where the trouble started."</p>
<p>The Gulf War also reinforced Turkish  sensitivities regarding national sovereignty. Generally speaking, the Turks have  been wary of allowing the United States to use their facilities for non-nato operations;  Özal's decision to allow the United States to use Turkish military facilities  to fly sorties into Iraq was the exception, not the rule. After the Gulf War, Turkey  allowed the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to use its bases to monitor  the no-fly zone over northern Iraq, but under significant constraints, including  the requirement that the agreement to use the bases be renewed every six months.  In recent years, the Turkish government has imposed increasing restrictions on U.S.  operations out of the Incirlik air base, in southern Turkey. Although Ankara has  allowed the Pentagon to use Incirlik to transport troops and materiel to Afghanistan  and Iraq, it has refused to permit the United States to station combat aircraft  at the base or use it to fly combat missions in the Middle East or the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003  drew Turkey more deeply into the vortex of Middle Eastern politics. From the outset,  Turkish leaders had strong reservations about the invasion. They had no love for  Saddam Hussein, but he provided stability on Turkey's southern border -- they worried  that his overthrow might fragment Iraq while strengthening Kurdish nationalism,  thereby jeopardizing Turkey's security. Since the invasion, the Turkish leadership's  worst fears have been realized. Iraq has become a breeding ground for international  terrorism, and it faces possible collapse. Iran's influence has increased in Iraq  and in the region more broadly. The Iraqi Kurds' drive for autonomy -- and, eventually,  formal independence -- has gained momentum. Turkish officials are concerned that the  creation of a Kurdish state on Turkey's southern border could exacerbate separatist  pressures among Turkey's own Kurdish population and pose a threat to the country's  territorial integrity.</p>

</div>
</div><p>This is a serious concern. Turkey has  witnessed an upsurge of violence by the pkk over the past few years. For over two  decades, the pkk has waged a guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey, killing more  than 35,000 Turks and Kurds. After the capture of its leader, Abdullah Öcalan,  in 1999, the pkk declared a unilateral cease-fire, and the violence temporarily  subsided. But the group took up arms again in June 2004. Since January 2006, it  has launched repeated attacks on Turkish territory from sanctuaries in the Kandil  Mountains, in northern Iraq, killing several hundred Turkish security forces.</p>
<p>The Erdogan government has repeatedly  requested U.S. military assistance to help eliminate pkk training camps in northern  Iraq. But Washington has been reluctant to take military action. With its forces  already stretched thin, the Pentagon claims it cannot spare the troops, which it  needs to combat the insurgency elsewhere in Iraq. Moreover, U.S. officials fear that  intervening against the pkk could unsettle northern Iraq, which is more stable than  the rest of the country. The Kurds have been the staunchest backers of U.S. policy  in Iraq, and without their support, hope for keeping the country together is slim.</p>
<p>Washington's di/dence has contributed  to an alarming rise in anti-American sentiment throughout Turkey. (A poll conducted  by the Pew Charitable Trusts in June 2006 showed that only 12 percent of Turks viewed  the United States positively.) Many Turks consider Washington's position to be tacit  support for the pkk and evidence of a double standard: as they see it, the United  States has invaded two countries -- Afghanistan and Iraq -- to eliminate terrorist  safe havens but now refuses to help Turkey do the same.</p>
<p>These problems are compounded by the  potentially explosive situation concerning the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, which  sits atop one of the world's largest oil deposits and whose status is to be determined  by a referendum before the end of the year. Over the past several years, hundreds  of thousands of Kurds who were evicted during Saddam's campaign to "Arabize" Kirkuk  in the 1970s and 1980s have returned to reclaim their homes and property. Now, the  Kurds of Iraq are seeking to make Kirkuk the capital of the Kurdistan Regional Government  in northern Iraq. But Turkish officials are concerned by the city's increasing "Kurdization."  Ankara wants power to be shared by all ethnic groups in the city and the referendum  to be postponed in the hope that the city's status can be clarified another way.  If the Iraqi Kurds try to force the issue, Ankara could be provoked to take military  action, which would exacerbate instability in Iraq and the region as a whole.</p>
<p>THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY</p>
<p>Turkey's greater activism in the Middle East  has also been reflected in its effort to strengthen ties to Iran and Syria. Ankara's  relations with Tehran and Damascus were strained in the 1980s and 1990s, in part  because Iran and Syria supported the pkk in their effort to destabilize Turkey. But  relations have significantly improved in recent years, thanks to the three governments'  shared interest in containing Kurdish nationalism and preventing the emergence of  an independent Kurdish state on their borders.</p>
<p>Turkey's cooperation with Iran has intensified  considerably, particularly in the security field. During Prime Minister Erdogan's  visit to Tehran in July 2004, Turkey and Iran signed a security cooperation agreement  that branded the pkk a terrorist organization. Since then, the two countries have  stepped up cooperation to protect their borders. Like Turkey, Iran faces security  problems in its Kurdish-populated areas: over the last year, an Iranian group affiliated  with the pkk, the Party for a Free Life in Iranian Kurdistan, has launched attacks  against Iranian security officials. Tehran has retaliated by shelling pkk bases in  the Kandil Mountains.</p>
<p>Energy has been another major driver  behind the warming of Iranian-Turkish relations. Iran is the second-largest supplier  of natural gas to Turkey (after Russia). In July 1996, shortly after taking office,  Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan concluded a $23 billion deal for the delivery  of natural gas from Iran over 25 years. In February 2007, under Prime Minister Erdogan,  Turkey and Iran agreed to seal two new energy deals: one allowing the Turkish Petroleum  Corporation (known as tpao) to explore oil and natural gas in Iran and another for  the transfer of gas from Turkmenistan to Turkey (and on to Europe) through a pipeline  in Iran. (Turkey's pipeline deal with Iran is at odds with Washington's preference  for avoiding Iran by transporting the gas through the Caspian Sea, and, if finalized,  it could add a new element of friction to U.S.-Turkish relations.)</p>
<p>Iran's nuclear ambitions, however,  are a source of serious concern in Ankara. A nuclear-armed Iran could have a destabilizing  impact on the Persian Gulf region and force Turkey to take countermeasures for its  own security. If Iran refuses to comply with the demands of the International Atomic  Energy Agency, Ankara will have essentially three options: expand its cooperation  on missile defense with the United States and Israel; beef up its conventional military  capabilities, especially medium-range missiles; or develop its own nuclear capability.  Turkey would consider developing the nuclear option only as a last resort -- if,  say, its relations with the United States declined, Ankara no longer saw nato's  guarantees as credible, and the eu rejected Turkey's membership. A serious effort  by Iran to develop a nuclear capability could undercut its rapprochement with Turkey  and drive Ankara to strengthen its ties with the West, especially the United States.</p>

</div>
</div><p>Turkey's relations with Syria have  also considerably improved in the last decade. Strained in the 1980s and early 1990s,  they reached a crisis point in October 1998, when Turkey threatened to invade Syria  if Damascus did not cease supporting the pkk. In the face of Turkey's overwhelming  military superiority, Damascus backed down, expelling the pkk leader Öcalan,  to whom it had given safe haven, and closing pkk training camps. Damascus' shift  opened the way for a gradual improvement in relations, which has gained considerable  momentum since then. This rapprochement was underscored by Syrian President Bashar  al-Assad's visit to Ankara in January 2005 -- the first trip by a Syrian president  to Turkey since Syria's independence in 1946.</p>
<p>This change in Syrian-Turkish relations  has largely been driven by Damascus' growing concern over the threat of Kurdish  nationalism. The Kurdish minority in Syria, like those in Turkey and Iran, has become  increasingly restless lately. Assad's government has been concerned that the emergence  of an economically robust Kurdish government in northern Iraq could stimulate pressures  for economic and political improvements among Syria's own Kurdish population.</p>
<p>Turkey's closer ties to Syria have  created strains with Washington. These tensions were not so strong under the Clinton  administration, which maintained a dialogue with Damascus despite disapproving of  many of its policies. However, they have intensified under the Bush administration,  which has sought to isolate Syria. Strains were particularly visible in the spring  of 2005, when U.S. officials failed to convince Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer  to cancel his visit to Damascus. Sezer, with Erdogan's backing, stood firm -- a  show of Turkish independence that caused considerable consternation in Washington.  However, recent efforts by the United States to initiate a dialogue with Syria -- a  move long favored by Ankara -- should help to reduce these strains and bring Washington's  and Ankara's approaches to Syria into closer alignment.</p>
<p>A DELICATE BALANCE</p>
<p>Ankara's policy toward Israel and the Palestinians  has also undergone a shift. Turkey had maintained a close relationship with Israel  since 1996, especially in the defense and intelligence areas. Cooperation had benefits  for both sides: it gave Israel a way of breaking out of its regional isolation and  a means of putting pressure on Syria, and it gave Turkey new avenues for obtaining  weapons and advanced technology at a time when it faced increasing restrictions  on weapons procurement from the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>But more recently, under the akp's leadership,  Turkey's outlook toward Israel has begun to change, and Ankara has begun to adopt  a more active pro-Palestinian policy. Erdogan has been openly critical of Israeli  policy in the West Bank and Gaza, calling it an act of "state terror." At the same  time, he has sought to establish closer ties to the Palestinian leadership. A few  weeks after the elections in the Palestinian territories in January 2006, he hosted  in Ankara a high-ranking Hamas delegation led by Khaled Mashaal. Erdogan was hoping  that the visit would highlight Turkey's ability to play a larger diplomatic role  in the Middle East. But it was arranged it without consulting Washington and Jerusalem  and irritated both governments, which wanted to isolate Hamas until it met a series  of specific conditions, including acceptance of Israel's right to exist.</p>
<p>Likewise, Turkey adopted an independent  position at odds with Israeli policy during last summer's crisis in Lebanon. Erdogan  sharply condemned the Israeli attacks, and in several major Turkish cities there  were large-scale protests and burnings of the Israeli flag. Turkish nongovernmental  organizations also condemned Israel's policies in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>At the same time, Erdogan decided to  send 1,000 troops to participate in the un peacekeeping force in Lebanon -- one  of the largest contributions of any European state. The move was sharply criticized  by mainstream parties and some members of Erdogan's own party, who feared Turkey  would be drawn into a military confrontation with Hezbollah, and provoked an open  split between President Sezer and Erdogan. Sezer opposed Turkish participation on  the grounds that it was "not Turkey's responsibility to protect others' national  interests." Erdogan maintained that Turkey could not protect its own national interests  by being a "mere bystander" and had to participate in the peace process.</p>
<p>Although not without risks, Erdogan's  decision to contribute troops to the un peacekeeping mission in Lebanon had a number  of important benefits. It both underscored Turkey's European credentials and showed  that Ankara is an important regional player. It earned Erdogan accolades in Washington,  which helped reduce strains with the United States. And along with Erdogan's criticism  of Israel's military action, it allowed Turkey to demonstrate its solidarity with  key Arab governments in the region, which supported the peacekeeping mission.</p>

</div>
</div><p>Turkey's relations with Saudi Arabia,  in particular, have been strengthened recently, as was highlighted by King Abdullah's  trip to Turkey in August 2006 -- the first visit of its kind in 40 years. The two  countries have worked together to invigorate the Arab-Israeli peace process as well  as to contain Iran's rising power. Turkey's ties to Egypt, another regional power,  have also been enhanced. During a visit to Ankara in March 2007, Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak and the Turkish leadership decided to establish a new strategic dialogue  and partnership focusing on energy cooperation and regional security.</p>
<p>MAKING IT WORK</p>
<p>Turkey's new activism in the Middle East -- particularly  its closer ties to Iran and Syria -- has caused concern in some quarters in Washington.  Some U.S. officials fear that it could weaken Turkey's ties to the West or lead to  the "Islamization" of Ankara's foreign policy. But these concerns are misplaced.  Turkey's greater engagement in the Middle East is part of the gradual diversification  of Turkish foreign policy since the end of the Cold War. In effect, Turkey is rediscovering  the region of which it has historically been an integral part. Especially under  the Ottomans, Turkey was the dominant power in the Middle East; its republican period -- with  its emphasis on noninvolvement in Middle Eastern affairs -- was an anomaly. Turkey's  current activism is a return to a more traditional pattern.</p>
<p>U.S. policymakers will, however, have to get  used to dealing with a more independent-minded and assertive Turkey. As a result  of its growing interests in the Middle East, Turkey is likely, for example, to be  extremely wary of allowing the United States to use its military facilities for  operations in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf when they do not clearly serve  its interests or nato's.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States  needs to build a stronger strategic partnership with Turkey. The much-heralded "Shared  Vision" document released in July 2006 by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and  Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül, which identifies concrete areas where  cooperation could be enhanced, provides a useful framework for building such a new  strategic partnership. But the United States and Turkey will need to make important  adjustments in its current policies if the plan's lofty goals are to be realized.</p>
<p>Both Ankara and Washington need to  accept that the war in Iraq has created new realities and unleashed new forces that  must be accommodated. However much they may wish for this, the clock cannot be turned  back. Two new realities in particular must be accepted. First, the chances that  a strong central government will emerge in Iraq -- the outcome favored by both Ankara  and Washington -- are almost nil. The differences between the various Iraqi political  forces are too strong, and the Iraqi Kurds would not accept a strong central authority  anyway. At best, a weak central government will emerge; at worst, Iraq will break  up into several entities. Second, northern Iraq is already a de facto quasi state.  It has a functioning government perceived as legitimate by the population, its own  army and national flag, and a strong sense of national identity.</p>
<p>Ankara also needs to accept that a  durable solution cannot be imposed by external forces; it can only come about as  a result of an accommodation between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds. This does not mean  Ankara must recognize or accept an independent Kurdish state in Iraq, but it will  need to open a dialogue with the Iraqi Kurdish leadership.</p>
<p>The Erdogan government seems to recognize  this. Over the last year, it has taken several small steps in the right direction.  It has authorized charter flights to two Kurdish cities and reopened the Turkish  consulate in Mosul. There is vigorous cross-border trade with the Kurds in northern  Iraq, particularly in crude oil and gasoline -- a vital source of economic support  for the Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Turkish military, however, opposes  such a dialogue: it claims that the two leading Kurdish groups in Iraq, the Kurdistan  Democratic Party, headed by Massoud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan,  headed by Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, are supporting the pkk militarily and  materially. Given the importance of the military in Turkish politics, especially  on sensitive issues of national security, the government will need its support -- or  at least its acquiescence -- if any dialogue with the Iraqi Kurds is to succeed.</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--6">
<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>While the Turkish military may exaggerate  the degree of support the pkk receives from the Iraqi Kurdish leaders, the latter  have not been sufficiently aggressive in cracking down on the pkk. Whether this is  because Iraqi Kurds see the pkk as a bargaining chip to be traded later for concessions  on Kirkuk or because they fear opposition from younger, more radical Kurdish leaders  is unclear. What is clear is that a tougher policy toward the pkk is a sine qua  non for easing tensions between the Iraqi Kurdish leadership and Turkey.</p>
<p>The United States needs to play a more  active role in helping defuse tensions between Ankara and the Iraqi Kurdish leadership.  The appointment last September of Joseph Ralston, a retired air force general and  former nato supreme allied commander for Europe, as the special envoy responsible  for coordinating efforts against the pkk was a step in the right direction. But his  mission has produced few concrete results. As a consequence, the Erdogan government  has come under growing pressure from the Turkish military to take unilateral military  action against the pkk -- a move that would be highly destabilizing and could lead  to a broadening of the conflict in Iraq.</p>
<p>At the same time, recent tensions between  the Erdogan government and the Turkish military over the selection of a new Turkish  president have threatened the country's own stability and made it all the more urgent  for the United States to get involved. Washington needs to press the Iraqi Kurdish  leadership harder, particularly the regional government of Kurdistan, to crack down  on pkk activities and close down pkk training camps. It should insist that the Iraqi  Kurdish authorities arrest pkk leaders -- many of whom roam freely in northern Iraq  and even appear on government-controlled television stations -- and turn them over  to the Turkish government. Such a move would have an enormous impact on public opinion  in Turkey and significantly reduce the growing anti-American sentiment there.</p>
<p>The United States should also encourage  the Turkish government to address more forthrightly the grievances of the Kurds  in Turkey. Ankara's actions should include a comprehensive effort to promote the  economic development of southeastern Turkey, one of the poorest and least developed  parts of the country and a prime source of recruitment for the pkk, especially among  younger Kurds. One useful measure would be to open up the Turkish political system  to greater participation by Kurdish groups in parliament. Most Turkish Kurds do  not agree with the pkk's goals or methods, but they feel it is the only group that  stands up for their interests. If Kurdish groups were given a greater opportunity  to openly represent these interests in parliament, sympathy for the pkk among Kurds  in Turkey would drop.</p>
<p>Finally, U.S. policymakers need to  pay more attention to Turkey's other security concerns, including the strategic  implications of Iran's nuclear ambitions. The prospect that Iran may obtain nuclear  weapons is likely to heighten Turkey's interest in missile defense. Yet, current  plans for deploying elements of a U.S. missile defense system in Poland and the  Czech Republic are designed to provide protection against only long-range missile  threats from Iran and North Korea, and they exclude southern Europe and Turkey,  effectively dividing Europe into two unequal zones of security. This is bound to  reinforce Turkey's sense of insecurity and its disenchantment with its Western allies  since it already faces a threat from Iran's short- and medium-range systems, some  of which can reach parts of eastern Turkey. The United States needs to develop a  short- and medium-range missile defense system -- perhaps through the deployment  of Patriot systems -- that can protect Turkey and the rest of southern Europe. Otherwise,  current plans could exacerbate Turkey's security concerns and create new strains  in Washington's relations with Ankara.</p>
<p>Taken together, these steps would demonstrate  that the United States is serious about addressing Turkey's key security concerns,  and they could provide the building blocks for developing a meaningful strategic  partnership with Ankara. Time is running out, however. Unless Washington quickly  takes more resolute steps to address these issues, U.S.-Turkish relations are likely  to deteriorate further, and the United States will lose a significant opportunity  to enhance stability in a region that is becoming vital to its own security.¶</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110454/ajax/content?token=pz_oos3JZi2s9IsS_y4-bKcL1g820ZHjWe2-tkppESE" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
