<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><!--break--><p>With its commandments and parables, its kings and its prophets, the Hebrew Bible has served as a reference point for Western politics for centuries. Almost <span class="s1">every kind of political movement, it seems</span>, has drawn its own message from the text. <span class="s2">For the contemporary left, it inspires calls </span><span class="s3">for social justice and the redistribution of </span>wealth. The right, meanwhile, uses it to preach adherence to traditional social <span class="s1">values and family structures. But what does </span><span class="s4">the Hebrew Bible actually have to say about politics? Is there a consistent set of political principles to be found in it? <em>In God’s Shadow</em>, a recent book by the philosopher Michael Walzer, attempts to tackle these questions. As Walzer observes, there’s a good reason why so many opposing movements claim the Hebrew Bible as their own: the book’s </span><span class="s3">stories, messages, and political arrange</span>ments are simply too diverse to fit under <span class="s2">any unified theory of government. In fact</span>, they give credence to many. 
</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">AN ALMOST DEMOCRACY</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">Walzer is one of the great thinkers of our </span>time, a scholar who rescued political <span class="s3">philosophy from a period of arid linguis</span><span class="s4">tic abstraction and gave it back its thick </span><span class="s6">texture, historical specificity, and intellectual </span><span class="s4">drama. Over a long and distinguished </span><span class="s1">career, he has proved immune to the siren </span>song of reductive theory, the search for what the British philosopher John Stuart<span class="s3"> Mill called “one very simple principle” to</span> solve complex problems. His main <span class="s2">argument, developed in the books <em>Spheres </em></span><span class="s1"><em>of Justice</em> and <em>Thick and Thin</em>, has been that </span><span class="s2">universal principles, whether in politics or </span>ethics, have limited traction. The essence <span class="s4">of political theory lies in the details, and the details are always local: set in a </span><span class="s2">particular </span>time, place, and culture. He <span class="s1">insists, however, that this is not an argument </span>for relativism. Every actual social order can be scrutinized and judged. But for the criticism to have force, it should <span class="s4">emanate from within the society it criticizes. Moral argument may not always begin at home, but home is where it usually belongs.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout his intellectual career, Walzer has also been fascinated by the </span><span class="s7">role of religion in political thought, </span><span class="s3">specifically how the Hebrew Bible has </span>influenced political movements. So it is with great anticipation that his followers <span class="s2">will turn to </span><span class="s1"><em>In God’s Shadow</em></span><span class="s2">, and they will </span>not be disappointed. Although brief, it covers the whole arena of politics in the <span class="s4">Bible. Walzer addresses the covenant </span><span class="s3">between God and the Israelites and its </span>renewals, the legal codes, and the biblical ethics of war. He examines the complex <span class="s3">story of the monarchy in biblical Israel </span><span class="s2">and the political outlooks of the prophets</span>, <span class="s2">priests, and “intellectuals” -- Walzer’s term </span><span class="s3">for the authors of what is referred to as </span><span class="s4">wisdom literature, which includes the </span><span class="s3">virtue-oriented books of Proverbs, Job, </span>and Ecclesiastes. He illustrates how the <span class="s3">exile of the Jews from their homeland </span>revolutionized the structures and sensi<span class="s3">bilities of what was ceasing to be the </span>political nation of Israel and becoming the religious community of Judaism. </p>

</div>
</div><p class="p4"><span class="s6">Walzer documents the sheer diversity</span> -- he calls it “pluralism” -- of the Hebrew <span class="s6">Bible’s approach to politics, in two different </span>senses. First, the text contains a multi<span class="s1">plicity of voices, each with its own tonality</span>, <span class="s2">concerns, and characteristic way of seeing </span><span class="s3">the world. The priests focused mostly on </span>holiness, the prophets on justice and compassion, and the royal courtiers on <span class="s1">practical wisdom. The canonization of the </span>Hebrew Bible preserved intact these distinctive perspectives and personalities.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Second, and no less significant, Walzer </span><span class="s3">records a series of unresolved tensions </span><span class="s2">about almost all the ideas and institutions </span><span class="s3">that appear in the pages of the Hebrew Bible. So, for instance, there are two </span><span class="s7">covenants, that of Abraham and that </span><span class="s3">of Moses, one emphasizing the bonds of </span><span class="s6">kinship, the other, the voluntary acceptance </span><span class="s2">of obligations (“descent” versus “consent,” </span>as Walzer neatly puts it). There are three <span class="s3">legal codes, one in Exodus, another in </span>Leviticus, a third in Deuteronomy. The <span class="s3">Hebrew Bible also puts forward two radically incompatible accounts of the </span><span class="s4">role of monarchy. One view, focused especially on King David, sees it as a </span><span class="s3">divinely ordained covenant, whereas the </span><span class="s2">other view, found in the book of Samuel, </span><span class="s3">regards it as a rejection of God’s rule. Then, there are two perspectives on the priesthood: a hierarchical one that sees </span><span class="s2">the priests as an elite and a more universal </span><span class="s6">aspiration that speaks of Israel as “a king</span><span class="s1">dom </span><span class="s2">of priests” in which all the people are summoned to holiness. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s7">Reading Walzer’s account, one is rem</span><span class="s4">inded of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s </span><span class="s3">remark that “a foolish consistency is the </span>hobgoblin of little minds”; by Walzer’s <span class="s3">lights, this adage applies to holy books as </span><span class="s1">well. More precisely, <em>In God’s Shadow</em> suggests that the Hebrew Bible is deliberately structured not as a consistent system </span>of thought but as a field of tensions.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">In highlighting all these incongruities</span>, <span class="s6">Walzer contends that although the Hebrew </span><span class="s1">Bible is full of political incident, it contains </span><span class="s2">no political theory, no account of an ideal </span><span class="s4">regime (such as one finds in Greek philosophy), no appreciation of politics </span><span class="s3">as a way of life, and no belief that any political leader could, on his own, shape the destiny of his people. The Bible has religious and moral teachings but not political ones. </span></p>
<p class="p4">The prophets had a domestic but not a foreign policy -- passionately concerned with justice at home, they believed that the fate of the nation was in the hands of <span class="s1">God. The entire prophetic message insofar </span><span class="s4">as wars and alliances were concerned </span>could be summed up in two words: Do nothing. As Moses tells the Israelites at the Red Sea, in Exodus 14, “The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your <span class="s3">peace.” The prophet Jeremiah evinces a </span><span class="s2">similar view when he advises the Israelites </span><span class="s1">to accept the Babylonian conquest. Nothing </span>the Jews could do would alter the fact that they were about to be punished by <span class="s4">defeat. God was moving the pieces on the chessboard of history, and belief in </span>their own power would lead the Judeans to disaster. In the biblical world, so long <span class="s1">and deep is the shadow God casts over the </span>affairs of humankind that there is little <span class="s6">space left for politics as normally conceived</span>.</p>
<p class="p4">That said, Walzer concludes by <span class="s2">suggesting that in three ways the political </span>system of the Israelites in the Hebrew Bible represents an “almost-democracy.” <span class="s4">First, the covenant between God and mankind involved everyone, including “socially subordinate and politically </span><span class="s3">powerless groups.” Second, the king had no legislative power. It was God, not a human ruler, who made the laws, and </span>even kings were subject to them. Politics <span class="s2">was only a matter of interpreting the laws</span>, and the task of interpretation was widely diffused throughout society. Third, the Israelites enjoyed a degree of freedom of dissent, evidenced by the prophets who spoke in a popular manner in the public domain (Walzer calls them “the first <span class="s2">social critics in the recorded history of the </span>West”). In the biblical world, prophecy was born simultaneously with monarchy; the critique of power appears at the same time as power itself.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So it was an “almost-democracy” -- but not democracy or any other form of </span><span class="s4">politics, either. “There can’t be fully </span>sovereign states, or a worked-out theory <span class="s4">of popular (or any other) sovereignty, so </span>long as God is an active sovereign,” <span class="s4">writes Walzer. “The people consent, but </span>they do not rule. Only when God is conceived to withdraw, to stand at some <span class="s1">distance from the world of nations, to give </span>up his political interventions, is there room for human politics.”</p>

    </script>
</div>
</div><p class="p2">SOFT POWER</p>
<p class="p1">Walzer is undeniably right that in one sense, God’s omnipotence in the biblical world precludes ordinary human politics. <span class="s2">His argument bears structural similarities </span><span class="s7">to those of the Jewish philosopher </span>Yeshayahu Leibowitz on ethics and the <span class="s2">Jewish historian Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi </span><span class="s3">on history. Leibowitz argued that the Hebrew Bible contains no ethics, since </span>ethics yields propositions such as “Love <span class="s4">thy neighbor as thyself,” whereas the </span>Bible yields sentences such as “Love thy neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord.” To act morally is to make choices -- that is, <span class="s3">to act autonomously -- and since the </span><span class="s4">Bible contains only divine commands, it </span><span class="s3">precludes moral behavior. Likewise, Yerushalmi argued that although the Bible seems to contain a great deal of </span><span class="s1">history, its stories must be read as memory</span>, since history involves the kind of detach<span class="s6">ment that cannot exist in a sacred text. And </span>so it makes sense that biblical Hebrew contains no abstract terms for politics, <span class="s3">ethics, or history, despite the Bible’s seeming interest in all three.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet even so, the Hebrew Bible has had an enormous influence on modern </span>political thought, as Walzer himself has chronicled. His first significant work, <span class="s6"><em>The Revolution of the Saints</em></span><span class="s2">, focused on the </span>Bible-based radicalism of the Calvinists and the Puritans, and his <span class="s1"><em>Exodus and Revolution</em></span> chronicled the role that the <span class="s3">Exodus story has played in the history </span>of <span class="s2">liberation movements. Even the radical Thomas Paine invoked the Hebrew Bible in his 1776 tract, </span><span class="s1"><em>Common Sense</em></span><span class="s2">. Mean</span><span class="s3">while</span><span class="s4">, leading politicians and think </span><span class="s3">tanks </span>continue to be interested in what the Hebrew Bible has to say. All of this suggests that despite the Hebrew Bible’s <span class="s2">inadequacy in addressing worldly political </span>questions of sovereignty and authority, it is still seen by many as a useful guide to modern politics. </p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">One reason for this is that the Hebrew </span><span class="s4">Bible has a lot to say about the limits of </span>power. Politics in the narrow sense is <span class="s1">concerned with the use, abuse, and justi-</span><span class="s2">fication </span>of power by governments. The Hebrew Bible, in several of its many voices, puts forward a sustained critique of power when used by humans against one another, individually or collectively. Cain kills. Pharaoh enslaves. Even King <span class="s4">David abuses his power, sending the </span>husband of his mistress to die in battle. When a prophet uses power to prove his <span class="s3">point, as when Elijah orders the death of </span>the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel after demonstrating God’s potency, the text implicitly criticizes him. God shows <span class="s3">Elijah that he is not to be found in the wind, the earthquake, or the fire but in a </span><span class="s2">“still small voice.” In this sense, Nietzsche </span>was correct to identify the Hebrew Bible, and Judaism more generally, as the prime enemy of the will to power.</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s4">Not only does the Hebrew Bible criticize power, but it also looks down on power’s natural home, the city. The first founder of a city, Cain, is also the </span><span class="s1">first murderer. Particularly in the book of </span><span class="s4">Genesis, cities are portrayed as places </span><span class="s8">o</span><span class="s9">f </span><span class="s7">hubris, as in Babel; of hostility to </span><span class="s6">strangers, as in Sodom; and of sexual excess</span>, <span class="s3">as in the Egyptian city where Joseph was </span>held captive. The Bible prefers the <span class="s4">simple relationships of families and </span>communities to the indulgences of city life, where money talks and power rules.</p>
<p class="p4">Moreover, the Hebrew Bible invokes <span class="s4">the sovereignty of God not to justify </span>human power- -- through the divine right of kings, for example -- but to criticize it, <span class="s4">diminish it, and, in a sense, secularize it. </span>The biblical writers were relatively <span class="s1">indifferent to political structures, believing </span><span class="s4">that the collective acceptance of the </span><span class="s3">covenant by the Jews committed them to </span>self-government in accordance with God’s law. Many of the biblical writers <span class="s1">were suspicious of centralized power. Some </span>were hostile to hierarchy. They recorded the moral failures of their greatest kings. And they were the first to acknowledge <span class="s2">that Israel was a small country surrounded </span><span class="s3">by empires with superior militaries. (As a fighting force, the Israelites were no more distinguished than the Moabites, the Amorites, the Edomites, or many </span>other minor nations of which little trace <span class="s3">remains.) Given the political situation of </span>Jeremiah’s time, his plea for the Jews <span class="s3">to do nothing to fight the Babylonian </span>conquest reads less like an otherworldly <span class="s3">reliance on divine intervention than a </span><span class="s4">politically pragmatic stance. When a </span><span class="s2">small </span>country faces a large and powerful empire, accommodation may be its most sensible option.</p>
<p class="p2">SOCIAL STUDIES</p>
<p class="p1">The Hebrew Bible is not only a critique <span class="s4">of power but also a treatise on where </span>politics belongs in the scheme of human <span class="s3">undertakings. It recognizes that there is life -- not just private but shared life -- outside politics. From quite early on in</span> their history, the Israelites seem to have sensed that they had encountered certain <span class="s4">truths that would one day resonate far </span>beyond their borders, and those truths, if not political, were not narrowly spiritual <span class="s2">either. They concerned welfare, employer</span>-employee relationships, debt and debt <span class="s4">relief, environmental matters, and so on. </span>They concerned society rather than the state. </p>
<p class="p4">As I once suggested in <span class="s1"><em>The Politics of </em></span><span class="s2"><em>Hope</em></span><span class="s3">, what makes the Hebrew Bible </span>unique in the history of political thought <span class="s3">is its dual account of the founding of the </span>Israelite nation. The first narrative, illustrating the birth of Israel as a “holy nation,” comes in Exodus 19–20, when the Israelites accept the Ten Commandments from God at Mount Sinai. The second, the birth of Israel as a worldly<span class="s4"> kingdom, appears in the first book of Samuel with the anointing of Saul as </span>king. The former was a covenant that created a society; the latter was a social contract that created a state. This duality meant that the Jews were able to survive as a society even without formal political institutions. Because the laws preceded <span class="s4">the kingdom, they remained in force </span>even when the Jews lost their land and became an exiled people. </p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p class="p4">The Israelites of the Hebrew Bible <span class="s1">never quite figured out how best to arrange </span><span class="s3">human political affairs. Many of them </span>believed they needed no other sovereign <span class="s1">than God, but they also knew that without </span><span class="s4">a worldly ruler, anarchy would reign. </span>And so the Hebrew Bible is not the best text on government and the relationship <span class="s2">between power and the will of the people</span>. That subject was the province of Athens,<span class="s6"> not Jerusalem. But given that Jewish society </span>has persisted and thrived for millennia, the text remains compelling on a number <span class="s1">of questions: How do civilizations survive</span>? How do they retain the moral energies <span class="s2">that first brought them to greatness? How </span>do they protect themselves against the <span class="s2">otherwise universal rule that principalities </span>and powers must decline and fall?</p>
<p class="p5">For those who care about the future of the West, the Hebrew Bible still has <span class="s6">much to say, if not about political structures </span>then about civil society and nonpolitical <span class="s3">virtues. That much, as Walzer notes, God leaves to us: “The world is God’s </span>stage. . . . But domestic society belongs, <span class="s1">for a time at least, to humankind.” And </span><span class="s6">for </span><span class="s2">the task of building a just and success</span><span class="s1">ful </span><span class="s2">society, the Hebrew Bible will continue </span><span class="s3">to be an essential guide.</span></p>
