<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>Jacques Hymans’ article “Botching the Bomb” (May/June 2012) is thought provoking, even if the only thought that comes to mind is one of bewilderment. <span class="s2">His argument -- that those countries </span>seeking nuclear weapons today face such <span class="s3">enormous operational challenges that </span>they may well fail -- is not totally without <span class="s3">merit. Yet Hymans underestimates the </span>incentives for states to push their nuclear <span class="s4">programs through despite these problems </span>and understates the capacity of dictatorships, in particular, to do so. 
</p>
<p class="p2">The absence of effective management <span class="s4">structures in authoritarian states might in </span><span class="s3">theory lead them to botch their nuclear programs. But so far, it hasn’t. Hymans fails to provide a convincing example for </span>his hypothesis. Sure enough, Iraq’s nuclear program was piling up costs, and Saddam Hussein’s frequent purges made <span class="s2">advances more incremental than they would otherwise have been. Yet incre</span>mental as Iraq’s progress was, the regime did arrive at a crucial threshold, beyond which only military action could stop it from acquiring a nuclear weapon. What Hymans fails to recognize is that authoritarian systems can afford to spend large <span class="s4">amounts of money on such programs and </span><span class="s1">accept slow progress precisely because they </span>are not held accountable.</p>
<p class="p2">But the real problem with Hymans’ line of argument is that it leads to deeply <span class="s2">faulty policy prescriptions. He draws a </span>comparison between Iraq and Libya, on <span class="s2">the one hand, and Iran, on the other. But the bureaucratic capabilities of Iran far exceed those of Libya and Iraq </span><span class="s4">combined</span> -- hardly a forgivable omission given that Hymans’ thesis rests on the assumption that all authoritarian states <span class="s4">share inefficient management procedures</span>. In fact, Iran has proved time and again that it has learned from the experiences of Iraq and Libya. </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Moreover, Hymans’ idea that too much pressure on Iran might galvanize the dictatorship into overcoming its nuclear management and organizational problems is troubling. Hymans </span><span class="s4">makes this argument on the premise that </span><span class="s2">in the absence of international action, the organizational challenges of Iran’s </span><span class="s4">program might prove too great to overcome</span><span class="s2">. Therefore, he warns the United </span><span class="s4">States against trying to stop Iran’s nuclear </span><span class="s2">program through covert actions along the lines of the Stuxnet computer worm or through a potential aerial bombing campaign. But Hymans himself knows </span><span class="s4">full well that even less capable states than </span><span class="s5">Iran, such as Pakistan, have advanced </span><span class="s2">all the way to completing their nuclear </span><span class="s4">programs, however incrementally. And he </span><span class="s2">cannot ignore that it was only interna</span>tional action -- diplomatic or otherwise<span class="s2"> -- that stopped the weapons programs of Iraq, Libya, and Syria. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4">It is irresponsible to rule out preventiv</span>e <span class="s3">action based on the slight chance that </span>Iran’s nuclear ambitions will fail on their own. Hope is not a strategy. </p>

</span><em>Senior Analyst, Global Governance Institute</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Hymans replies:</em></span><span class="s7"> </span></p>
<p class="p2">Dustin Dehez explicitly accepts the <span class="s3">validity of my article’s central point: bad </span><span class="s8">internal management has had a debilitating </span><span class="s4">effect on recent nuclear weapons projects</span>. His objection to my thesis is that if states are allowed to keep plugging away at <span class="s2">their nuclear projects, no matter how </span>poorly managed they are, eventually they <span class="s2">will succeed in producing the bomb. This argument misses the point: the </span><span class="s3">policy debate on this issue centers not on </span>the possibility of a state’s eventually developing nuclear weapons but on the <span class="s4">likely time frame in which the state might </span><span class="s5">do so. And in recent decades, those </span>estimates have proved far too pessimistic, <span class="s2">in part because the calculations have </span>underestimated the extent to which bad <span class="s4">administration bungles a nuclear program. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Dehez repeats the old canard that after a decade of determined efforts, Iraq made it to the point where “only military <span class="s2">action could stop it from acquiring a </span>nuclear weapon.” Yet as I detailed in my <span class="s2">article, Iraq’s attempts in the 1980s to enrich uranium on an industrial scale </span>were largely unsuccessful. Iraq seemed <span class="s1">close to a nuclear weapon at the time of </span><span class="s3">the Gulf War only because France and </span><span class="s4">Russia had handed it a significant quantity </span>of highly enriched uranium reactor fuel for its civil nuclear program many years earlier. Moreover, even the 1990–91 “crash program” to repurpose that fuel for nuclear bombs was an organizational disaster that the regime itself appears to <span class="s3">have quickly lost faith in, as evidenced by </span>the callous decision to force its top scientists to remain inside their nuclear facilities as human shields during the U.S. air campaign. </p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">It is clear that Iran is further ahead in </span>its nuclear work than Iraq was in the <span class="s1">early 1990s. Still, for well over two decades</span>, <span class="s1">Iran’s nuclear output has consistently failed </span>to live up to the claims of the country’s <span class="s1">politicians and the best guesses of Western </span>intelligence agencies. The most plausible explanation for Iran’s underwhelming <span class="s1">nuclear performance to date is the rampant </span><span class="s3">mismanagement visible throughout the country’s industrial economy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s4">Dehez also claims that I understate the </span>role that international action has played in curtailing the nuclear efforts of states <span class="s4">such as Iraq and Libya. In fact, my article </span>credits the international nonproliferation regime for slowing the spread of nuclear <span class="s4">weapons since the early 1990s. But Dehez has something more radical in mind when </span>he uses the term “international action.” <span class="s1">His letter reflects the common assumption </span><span class="s8">that the harder you try to stop proliferation</span>, the more effective you will be. Therefore, <span class="s1">if diplomacy fails to halt a state’s suspicious </span>nuclear activities, impose sanctions. And <span class="s4">if sanctions don’t do it, start bombing. But in fact, bombing can make a bad situation </span>worse. The basis of the preventive-strike doctrine is only a faint hope that a few air sorties will cause would-be nuclear weapons states to abandon their national pride and bow down before the foreign <span class="s4">devils. And to quote Dehez: “Hope is not </span>a strategy.” That’s why I prefer analysis. </p>
