<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p class="p1">In “The Scottish Play” (September/<span class="s1">October 2012), Charles King briefly distinguishes the separatist movement in </span>Scotland from that in Quebec. “The Québecois quest for independence,” he <span class="s2">writes, “involved a religious and linguistic </span><span class="s1">minority seeking to secure its status against perceived English-speaking </span>dominance.” In contrast, “not only is it difficult today to define an ‘ethnic Scot,’ <span class="s1">but the SNP [Scottish National Party] has </span>understood that its greatest hope for <span class="s3">differentiating Scotland from the rest of </span>the United Kingdom is to embrace values, not nationality, as the region’s defining principle.”</p>
<p class="p1">But today’s separatists in Quebec may not be so different from their Scottish <span class="s4">counterparts. Thanks in part to the changes </span><span class="s5">King mentions -- the federal government’s </span>increased commitment to bilingualism, economic growth, and immigration from <span class="s4">Africa and Asia -- Quebec’s separatists have </span>moved away from ethnic and linguistic <span class="s2">arguments for independence. Instead, they </span><span class="s3">have gravitated to strategies that are </span><span class="s5">strikingly similar to those used by the SNP</span>.</p>
<p class="p1">Since 2006, when Canadian Prime <span class="s5">Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative</span>, was elected, Québecois separatists have insisted, like the <span class="s5">SNP</span>, that the federal government’s values are inimical to those of their region. The province’s separatist<span class="s2"> party, the Parti Québécois (PQ), has argued </span>that unlike the Harper government, an independent Quebec would take better <span class="s4">care of its underprivileged citizens, preserve </span><span class="s2">social programs, and better protect </span>the environment -- all similar arguments to those made by the <span class="s5">SNP</span>. Both the <span class="s5">SNP</span> and <span class="s5">the PQ also assert that their new countries</span>’ foreign policies would focus on peace<span class="s5">making rather then military intervention</span>; <span class="s1">an independent Quebec, according to Pauline Marois, the leader of the </span><span class="s5">PQ</span><span class="s1">, </span>would no longer spend billions of dollars to “buy war planes and war boats.” </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s5">For the last 40 years, Quebec’s separatists </span>have steadfastly railed against the central government’s policies, brilliantly adjusting their criticism to the changing context. Those repeated attacks have <span class="s2">changed most Qu</span><span class="s6">é</span><span class="s2">becois’ views of Canada for the worst, although not yet to the point </span><span class="s4">where they consider separation worthwhile</span>. Quebec’s federalists, meanwhile, have been singularly clumsy in their replies. <span class="s1">King is right when he argues that “it </span>would be a shame if the Scottish model became . . . a handbook for transforming <span class="s3">muscular regionalism into territorial separatism” -- which is why, like many Qu</span><span class="s2">é</span><span class="s3">becois who oppose separation, I follow the situation in Scotland with interest and more than a little anxiety.</span></p>
