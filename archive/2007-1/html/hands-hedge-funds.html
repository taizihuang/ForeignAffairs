<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>LOCUSTS  OR FIRE FIGHTERS?
</p>
<p>Imagine two successful companies. Both are staffed  by very smart people; both are innovative; both have an impact far beyond their  industry, improving the productivity of the capitalist system as a whole. But the  first, based near San Francisco, is the subject of adoring newspaper profiles, whereas  the second, based in the New York area, is usually vilified.
</p>
<p>Actually, you do not have to imagine any of  this, because it describes a double standard that already exists. The first company  in the story is a technology firm; the second is a hedge fund. As any newspaper  reader knows, technology firms are the leading edge of the U.S. knowledge economy;  they made possible the productivity revolution of the past decade. But the same  could just as well be said of hedge funds, which allocate the world's capital to  the companies, industries, and countries that can use it most productively.
</p>
<p>Of course, that is not how hedge funds  are viewed most of the time. The recent implosion of Amaranth Advisors -- a hedge  fund that lost $6 billion in a matter of days thanks to one Ferrari-driving 32-year-old  trader (and his greedy bosses' abandonment of proper risk management) -- has rekindled  the fears that attended the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, an  event that even then Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan believed "could have potentially  impaired the economies of many nations, including our own."
</p>
<p>In the United States, the Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) has tried to regulate the sector further -- a 2004  SEC rule requiring the registration of hedge-fund advisers was vacated by a federal  court in 2006 -- and continues to be interested in increasing oversight. The attorney  general of Connecticut, a state in which many hedge funds are headquartered, has  set up a special unit to prosecute hedge-fund abuses and decries what he regards  as the "regulatory black hole" in which these funds exist. In East Asia, governments  still blame hedge funds for their supposed role in the 1997-98 financial crisis.  And in Europe, Franz MÃ¼ntefering, Germany's deputy chancellor, has complained  that hedge funds "remain anonymous, have no face, fall like a plague of locusts  over our companies, devour everything, then fly on to the next one."

</div>
</div><p>Such antipathy seems likely only to  intensify as hedge funds continue their extraordinary growth. In the eight years  since Long-Term Capital collapsed, the volume of money managed by U.S. hedge funds  has risen from about $300 billion to well over $1 trillion, according to HedgeFund  Intelligence. In Europe and Asia, meanwhile, assets under hedge-fund management  have grown to $325 billion and $115 billion, respectively, and London has emerged  as a hedge-fund center second only to the New York area. The total assets in the  hedge-fund sector remain much smaller than those in banks and pension funds. But  whereas hedge-fund assets have quintupled in eight years, the world's stock of equities,  tradable debt, and bank deposits has only doubled, according to data from the McKinsey  Global Institute. Moreover, because the sector as a whole is leveraged and some  funds trade intensively, hedge funds are thought to account for a third of the turnover  in U.S. equities and an even higher share in more exotic financial instruments.
</p>
<p>The fear of the growing influence of  hedge funds is compounded by the aura of mystery that surrounds them. Whereas financial  markets thrive on transparency, hedge funds are limited in what they can disclose  to the public at large. They are sold through privately distributed prospectuses  that describe the funds' investment parameters, terms of investment, redemption  rules, and the like. But even some of the fund-of-funds managers who have emerged  as expert intermediaries between hedge funds and investors have only a general idea  of the trading strategies that some of their component funds pursue.
</p>
<p>The suspicion is pervasive enough to  make a new regulatory push seem probable. This past October, Senator Chuck Grassley  (R-Iowa), the outgoing chair of the Senate Finance Committee, complained in a letter  to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that ordinary Americans are increasingly exposed  to hedge funds via their pension plans and demanded to know why the funds are allowed  to get away with secrecy. Press coverage is suffused with the supposition that more  regulation would be welcome, and even an October survey of private economists conducted  by The Wall Street Journal found that a majority favored tougher oversight. Industry  leaders who once might have urged regulators to leave them alone now plead instead  only that restrictions should avoid being too onerous. And European regulators are  as keen to subject hedge funds to controls as their American counterparts.
</p>
<p>But the fear of hedge funds is overblown,  based more on ignorance or simplistic caricatures than on actual knowledge. Many  of the proposals for new regulation are so vague as to be impossible to evaluate  or are poorly suited to address the supposed problems at issue. And even the most  serious cause for concern -- that hedge-fund operations might generate a "systemic  risk" for the financial system as a whole -- is neither limited to the hedge-fund  sector nor best addressed through regulation of it. Rather than seeing hedge funds  as sources of dangerous financial fires, in fact, it is more accurate to see them  as the financial system's benevolent fire fighters -- and to let them have the tools  they need to do their jobs well.
</p>
<p>MYTHS AND FACTS
</p>
<p>Along with the growth of the hedge-fund sector  has come variation that makes generalizations difficult. Hedge funds are private investment  pools allowed to operate with a great deal of freedom and flexibility, including  having the ability to leverage their assets through borrowing and to bet that stocks  will fall as well as rise. Some use intensely mathematical methods; others pursue  stock-picking strategies that depend on human judgment about the quality of corporate  managers. Some borrow and trade aggressively; others do not. Arbitrage funds take  no view on markets' fundamental value but exploit price misalignments between equivalent  assets; other funds trade on convictions about value, using various methods of assessing  it.
</p>
<p>If hedge funds are not actually an army of  undifferentiated attack clones, neither are they entirely unregulated, despite the  popular image. Like any other investors, hedge-fund managers are subject to prosecution  for insider dealing or fraud; they are overseen by the SEC if they have broker or  dealer affiliates; they may be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  if they trade futures or by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission if they trade  energy contracts; their borrowing is indirectly monitored by the Federal Reserve;  and so on. Further regulation may or may not be appropriate, but any benefits it  might bring would have to be measured against the risks of impeding innovation in  the capital markets -- an outcome that would be about as desirable as stifling innovation  in Silicon Valley.

</div>
</div><p>Popular resentment of hedge funds begins  with the suspicion that they earn too much. The founder-owners of the most successful  firms do take home several hundred million dollars annually, much more than top  Wall Street executives. Reporting from the epicenter of this gold rush, the Stamford  Advocate observed recently that six local hedge-fund managers pocketed a combined  $2.15 billion in 2005. Such payouts are the result of hedge funds' unique fee structures,  which combine large annual management fees with a share of annual investment profits.
</p>
<p>But the sophisticated investors who  pay such fees do so voluntarily, because they believe that the returns they will  receive will more than compensate for those fees. Hedge-fund managers who do poorly  or do not outperform relevant indices will soon have no money left to manage: in  2005, 848 hedge funds went out of business. And high performance fees can be less  corrupting than the alternative. Since they rely only on management fees, for example,  mutual-fund companies have an incentive to focus on boosting the volume of the money  under their management rather than on their investment performance.
</p>
<p>The extraordinary earnings of the top  hedge-fund managers reflect the workings of a daunting star system. Every year,  hundreds of smart analysts sign up to join the industry, just as thousands of aspiring  movie stars arrive in Hollywood. Only a few do enough to justify the high fees charged:  come up with an insight into how a certain company or currency has been mispriced,  see illogical discrepancies between the prices of sets of financial assets, and  so forth. And those who do come up with such breakthroughs not only make fortunes  for themselves and their clients. By buying irrationally cheap assets and selling  irrationally expensive ones, they shift market prices until the irrationalities  disappear, thus ultimately facilitating the efficient allocation of the world's capital.
</p>
<p>If some are concerned about hedge-fund  managers' compensation, others are concerned about their integrity. Arguing for  its rule requiring hedge-fund advisers to register themselves and be subject to  inspections, the SEC cited 51 fraud cases involving hedge funds between 2000 and  2004 and claimed that at the time of the rule's adoption, in 2004, 400 hedge funds  and at least 87 hedge-fund advisers were under investigation.
</p>
<p>An industry of around 9,000 hedge funds  is indeed bound to harbor some criminals. But insider trading is already illegal,  and prosecutors have the tools to go after offenders in hedge funds without new regulations.  The number of fraud cases suggests that regulators are not shy about using these  powers, and hedge funds regularly experience inquiries from the SEC when they happen  to trade heavily in a stock ahead of a price-moving announcement. Moreover, some  of what politicians and journalists label "hedge-fund abuses" involve leaks of inside  information from investment banks rather than from hedge funds, making the hedge-fund  managers who receive the leaks accomplices rather than the chief offenders.
</p>
<p>Still other critics attack hedge funds  for the consequences of their buying and selling decisions. Thus, Germany's deputy  chancellor compared hedge funds to locusts because of their role in hostile takeovers  of German companies, and some Britons vilified George Soros because his hedge fund  upended the British government's economic policy in 1992. And after the East Asian  crisis in the late 1990s, Malaysia's prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad, lamented  that "all these countries have spent 40 years trying to build up their economies  and a moron like Soros comes along with a lot of money to speculate and ruins things."
</p>
<p>The common assumption underlying such  criticisms is that politicians know and seek the public good, whereas market forces,  represented here by hedge funds, seek only profits, without regard to any costs  or consequences that might follow. But German politicians' objections to hostile  takeovers have little to do with any rational conception of the public good, and  a lot to do with their cozy relationship with incumbent captains of industry. And  although the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) may have appealed to British  Prime Minister John Major, anxious to differentiate himself from his Europe-bashing  predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, his country's membership in the ERM made no economic  sense after Germany refused to raise taxes to pay for unification, thus generating  interest rates high enough to threaten recession in the United Kingdom. By betting  against the pound and helping to destroy the ERM, Soros ended up making money not  by economic vandalism but by liberating Britons from their leaders' unsustainable  choices. As the economist Melvyn Krauss and the former hedge-fund manager Michael  Simoff have written, hedge funds may be a disruptive force -- but they disrupt what  needs disrupting.
</p>
<p>RISK MANAGEMENT
</p>
<p>Hedge funds are sometimes accused of destabilizing  capital markets. This is the fear that goes back to the collapse of Long-Term Capital  Management: that the implosion of a major hedge fund could be devastating not merely  for its investors but for the broader financial system as well. Regulators in both  the United States and Europe have expressed some variant of this worry, and not  without reason. But the dangers created by hedge funds need to be balanced against  the many ways in which the funds actually reduce risk.
</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--4">

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Contrary to popular mythology, hedge funds  are not precipice dwellers. In the United States and Europe, regulations restrict  access to hedge funds to rich individuals and institutions on the theory that the  funds are too risky for the average investor. But because most hedge funds hold  a portfolio of positions and can go short as well as long -- borrowing stocks and  selling them, in the hopes of buying them back after their prices have fallen -- they  can be less volatile than individual stocks or standard mutual funds. After the  technology bubble burst, investors discovered that holding supposedly sedate stock-index  funds could make for a bumpy ride; meanwhile, hedge funds as a group delivered strong  positive returns over the period. The best way for large investors to avoid the  precipice is to hold a diversified portfolio of investments, in which hedge funds  can certainly play a part.
</p>
<p>Moreover, hedge funds collectively  do not so much create risk as absorb it. The funds can be viewed as quasi insurers;  by shouldering risks that others wish to avoid, they remove a potential obstacle  to business. For example, banks have to limit their lending for fear that borrowers  might default. But hedge funds are willing to buy credit derivatives that transfer  the default risk from the banks to themselves -- freeing the banks to finance more  economic activity. Similarly, companies may reduce their cross-border activities  if there is a limit to the foreign currency exposure they are willing to take on.  Hedge funds help to manage that exposure by trading in the currency derivatives  that companies use to insure themselves.
</p>
<p>Hedge funds can also reduce the danger  that economies will overrespond to shocks. If a currency or stock market starts  to plummet, the best hope for stability lies in self-confident, deep-pocketed investors  willing to bet that the fall has gone too far, and hedge funds are well designed  to perform this function. Whereas mutual-fund managers must be cautious about bucking  conventional wisdom because the returns they generate are measured against market  indices that reflect the consensus, hedge funds are rewarded for absolute returns,  which allows their managers to engage in independent thinking. Moreover, many hedge  funds have "lock-up" rules that prevent investors from withdrawing money on short  notice; when crises strike, the funds have the freedom to be buyers.
</p>
<p>This does not mean that they will extend  a safety net every time a market falls. But in 1988, the Brady Commission report  on the stock-market collapse of the previous year found that hedge funds had been  net buyers during the crash. And contrary to Mahathir's fulminations, it was banks  that caused the flight of "hot money" from East Asia during the 1997-98 crisis -- with  hedge funds being among the first to go back in.
</p>
<p>Finally, hedge funds can reduce the  chances that markets will rise to unsustainable levels in the first place. Unlike  most other investors, they can profit from falls in the market as well as from rises.  Their ability to short stocks has given rise to a cottage industry of specialist  funds that scour the financial press for glowing corporate profiles and bet against  the hype. Hedge-fund managers can make mistakes or fall prey to groupthink, just  as anybody else can, but they have greater flexibility and more incentives than  other investors to buck trends rather than follow them.
</p>
<p>NIGHTMARE ON WALL STREET?
</p>
<p>If hedge funds reduce and manage risk in all  these ways, what of the systemic risk that concerns regulators? That risk is real -- but  restrictions on hedge funds are the wrong way to deal with it.
</p>
<p>From a policy perspective, it does not matter  if one hedge fund goes down. The fund's investors take a hit, but they were presumably  aware of the risks all along. Ordinary citizens may be increasingly exposed to hedge  funds via their retirement plans, as Senator Grassley says, but large corporate  pension funds allocate on average only about one percent of their assets to hedge  funds, so that exposure is trivial. What matters is whether a collapse has knock-on  effects, particularly for the banking system more generally.
</p>
<p>Banks are exposed to hedge funds in  part because they lend to them. When Long-Term Capital Management collapsed in 1998,  it emerged that banks had lent it enough to be left with significant losses. But  the answer to this problem is not to regulate hedge funds but to do better at supervising  the already regulated banks. This is what the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and  its European counterparts have done. Since Long-Term Capital Management's collapse,  banks have lent hedge funds only money that the banks could afford to lose. In the  late 1990s, hedge-fund borrowing peaked at about 2.5 times capital (meaning that  every dollar in the sector was supplemented by an additional 2.5 dollars of borrowed  money); today, according to JP Morgan, the borrowing amounts to only a little more  than the capital in the sector.
</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--5">
<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--5');
            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Banks are also exposed to the possibility  that trouble at one hedge fund will create trouble at others. Hedge funds tend to  invest on margin: they borrow money so that they can buy stocks, bonds, or various  derivative contracts, and the lending banks then retain those financial instruments  as collateral. If an investment loses value, the bank issues a margin call, demanding  that the hedge fund pony up fresh capital to replenish the collateral; this can  force a fund to sell its holdings just as they are losing value. If a hedge fund  is a big player, the pressure of its selling could potentially drive prices down  further -- triggering another round of margin calls and another round of forced  selling. If such a vicious cycle drove down the value of a particular part of the  market, others who invested in it could also see their assets wiped out.
</p>
<p>The nightmare scenario involves a host  of hedge funds making similar bets. If the bets turn out to be wrong, a fund could  unravel, causing the others to unravel in turn -- and banks that could comfortably  swallow the default of one or two funds might find themselves overwhelmed by the  default of dozens. The banks themselves, moreover, may have made similar bets through  their own proprietary trading desks, meaning that their own capital would be taking  a hit just when it was needed to cushion losses on hedge-fund lending. When Timothy  Geithner, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, sounded a warning  about hedge funds this past September, this is what was worrying him.
</p>
<p>Geithner was not, however, saying that  the nightmare scenario is likely. In financial markets, there has to be someone  on both sides of each trade; if a group of hedge funds is betting heavily on a fall  in energy prices or the convergence of Latin American interest rates, somebody else  must be betting just as heavily on the opposite outcome. Viewed globally, this system  of wagers is a giant zero-sum game. In order to be worried, you have to believe  that one side of some risky bet is concentrated in a particular corner of the financial  system, and that it could collapse without the other parts of the system coming  to the rescue.
</p>
<p>Such a possibility is real, but it  does not justify a clampdown on hedge funds. To the contrary, the proliferation  of hedge funds actually diminishes the risk of the nightmare scenario, and so regulation  that discouraged the creation of new funds would be counterproductive. The more  hedge funds there are, the less likely it is that they will all be concentrated  on one side of a given trade, and the more likely it is that if trouble at one hedge  fund initiates a downward spiral in a particular corner of the market, falling prices  will draw in other funds smelling a bargain.
</p>
<p>This is precisely what happened after  Amaranth's collapse this past September: the fund had to sell its positions fast,  and others (including other hedge funds) were only too happy to accept the resulting  discount. Because they are global, opportunistic, and nimble, hedge funds are likely  to pile into any market where the distress of other institutions creates anomalous  pricing.
</p>
<p>It is true that if hedge funds become  very large, they pose a more serious risk. If Amaranth had lost $26 billion rather  than $6 billion, it might have been harder for other market players to take over  its trading positions. Troubling concentrations of risk can occur within banks as  much as within hedge funds: part of the nightmare scenario lies in the direct risk  to the banks from their own proprietary trading desks, and banks such as Morgan  Stanley have been building up their asset-management business by buying stakes in  hedge funds. But imposing some arbitrary regulatory cap on the size of hedge funds  would unjustly penalize successful firms. The best safeguard against the risk posed  by large funds is the presence of other large funds.
</p>
<p>THE AGE OF UNCERTAINTY
</p>
<p>If it is wrong to discourage the formation  of new hedge funds and wrong to impose a limit on funds' size, what of other possible  regulatory options? Some call for limits on funds' borrowing. But that might curtail  their ability to act as opportunistic buyers in a crisis: it would ration the fire  fighters' access to the fire hydrants.
</p>
<p>Others call for more disclosure, which would  allow lenders and regulators to gauge whether funds are crowding dangerously onto  one side of a particular trade. But periodic snapshots of a fund's positions might  reveal little if it trades intensively, and even extensive disclosures can fail  to reveal a fund's real risks. In a 2005 paper for the National Bureau of Economic  Research, Nicholas Chan, Mila Getmansky, Shane Haas, and Andrew Lo demonstrated  how a hedge fund could report strong and consistent returns over 96 months and still  present a risk of sudden implosion. A further reason to be cautious in demanding  disclosure is that hedge-fund privacy can serve a useful purpose. Without a right  to privacy, funds could not be sure of capturing the value of their intellectual  property, as there is no patent protection for trading strategies. Forcing disclosure  indiscriminately on all funds could thus damage their incentive to discover and  correct market inefficiencies.
</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--6">

            googletag.cmd.push(function() {
                googletag.display('js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--6');
            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Rather than forcing more disclosure,  it would be better to allow the market to promote it. As the hedge-fund industry  has grown, it has gradually become more transparent. Brokers that supply leverage  to hedge funds have grown more insistent on understanding their clients' risks.  Proliferating funds of funds demand at least a general description of their exposure  from the hedge-fund managers to whom they entrust capital. These pressures give  hedge funds an incentive to disclose more than they have in the past, since the  more they reveal, the more readily they can raise capital. And in some cases, funds  may choose to reveal a lot. In November, Fortress Investment Group, which manages  private equity funds and hedge funds, took the radical step of seeking a public  listing, with all the disclosure requirements that come with it. Other funds may  decide that secrecy is so important to their business model that it is worth accepting  higher costs of capital, and they should be free to make that judgment.
</p>
<p>In the end, the critics of hedge funds  would do well to remember why this sector has emerged as such a force. Until the  late 1960s, the financial world was quaintly stable: exchange rates were inflexible,  interest rates were regulated, and the whole system was anchored by a fixed gold  price. But that world collapsed when inflation drove the dollar off the gold standard  and currencies and interest rates began to float; from then on, it became impossible  to amass savings without facing financial uncertainty. Tools for coping with that  uncertainty -- deep markets in futures, options, and other derivative instruments -- sprang  up in response to the newly volatile environment. And hedge funds emerged as the  masters of these tools, providing quasi insurance to investors and firms and introducing  a healthy dose of contrariness into financial markets. For this, they are accused  of generating risk. But their real systemic function is to manage it -- and it is  their very success in doing so that has generated both their profits and their phenomenal  growth.
