<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT
</p>
<p>Once upon a time, not very long ago, economic  globalization -- the free worldwide flow of capital, goods, and labor -- looked  both inevitable and inexorable. Most governments seemed to embrace the very real  benefits being offered by rapid technological change and international markets and  sought to liberalize their economies in order to maximize these gains. Policymakers  worked to prepare their societies for a world of ever-increasing interconnectedness  and relentless competition, and the debate -- at least within the United States -- started  to revolve around how to cope with the effects of this new "flat" earth.
</p>
<p>Then came the financial crises of the 1990s  and the early years of this century in Asia, Russia, and Latin America. The U.S.  current account deficit -- the difference, broadly speaking, between what U.S. residents  spend abroad and what they sell abroad -- shot upward. The U.S. dollar fell in value  and seemed headed for an even more precipitous drop. As outsourcing accelerated,  the American middle class came to feel increasingly insecure. Historians such as  Niall Ferguson and Harold James pointed out that the previous era of globalization  (which ran from about 1870 to 1914) had once seemed as unstoppable as the current  one but had ended disastrously; so, too, they warned, could today's.
</p>
<p>But will it? Has the current age of  globalization already started to come to a close? Will the process of integration  continue, or will it grind to a halt?
</p>
<p>The paradoxical answer is neither of  these scenarios. The technological revolution that has driven the current wave of  globalization will continue. Communication will become still cheaper and easier,  allowing corporations to spread their operations -- research and development, design,  and manufacturing -- around the planet. Companies will exploit scientific talent  in other countries to spark a new wave of technological innovation.
</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>At the same time, certain barriers  will start to rise. The institutional foundations of globalization -- such as the  rules that oblige governments to keep their markets open and the domestic and international  politics that allow policymakers to liberalize their economies -- have weakened  considerably in the past few years. Politicians and their constituents in the United  States, Europe, and China have grown increasingly nervous about letting capital,  goods, and people move freely across their borders. And energy -- the most globalized  of products -- has once more become the object of intense resource nationalism,  as governments in resource-rich countries assert greater control and ownership over  those assets.
</p>
<p>Taken together, these contradictory  trends indicate the shape of things to come. The picture is muddled. Although globalization  as a process will continue to sputter along, the idea of unrestrained globalization  will wane in force. As Cornell's Peter Katzenstein has argued, globalization and  internationalization are not the same. The more prosaic process of internationalization -- that  is, exchanges across borders -- can and will continue, even as the transformative  ideological process of breaking down barriers slows considerably.
</p>
<p>Much now depends on how national governments  respond to these changing circumstances; they could still make conditions better  or worse. As the integration of national economies stalls, maintaining the high  degree of openness already established will require deft management. U.S. policymakers,  in particular, need to do a better job of countering their constituents' wariness  of global markets and managing the political backlash against openness that has  already begun. The challenge is to sell the benefits of ongoing globalization to  a wary public, to make sure those benefits materialize, and then to ensure they  are distributed more equitably.
</p>
<p>DOUBLE VISION
</p>
<p>In retrospect, signs of the current slowdown  in globalization have been obvious for some time. Major participants in the process  have always had very different ideas about how the integration should occur. As a  result, what often looked like a single, steady process turns out to have been conducted  along two, sometimes contradictory tracks.
</p>
<p>On one side of the ideological split stood  the United States. Washington's approach to globalization has long been ad hoc,  meaning that it has relied on the preponderant power of the U.S. Treasury and of  private U.S. firms to strike bilateral deals directly with other countries. U.S.  policymakers tend to be skeptical of global rules and international organizations,  favoring individual and specific trade and investment treaties instead. Admittedly,  the United States has offered modest support for international organizations at times,  but never at the expense of its own preeminent role in the world economy. This approach  has been effective from the United States' perspective, as it has placed the country  firmly at the center of global markets.
</p>
<p>European policymakers, meanwhile, have  favored a different tack, trying to drive globalization by creating new overarching  rules for the world economy and by empowering international organizations such as  the European Union (EU), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Trade Organization  (WTO). The European doctrine of managed globalization envisions a world of multilateral  rules that will supersede U.S. power. Over the years, the EU alone has compiled  over 80,000 pages of regulations to ensure the interdependence of its members -- the  greatest body of such rules ever produced.
</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--3">

            googletag.cmd.push(function() {

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>These two very different visions of  how globalization should progress have never been harmonized, and this conflict  has weakened the foundations of globalization in recent years. Consider the role  of capital. In the last few years, restrictions on the flow of investment between  countries have increased despite some regional attempts to move in the opposite  direction. The EU, for example, forbids its members from restricting the movement  of capital within Europe, and the OECD requires its members to maintain open capital  accounts. But there is no global rule requiring all countries to permit unhindered  foreign investment. That institutional void is not for want of trying; during the  1990s, the IMF's management attempted to get its members to give the organization  the authority to mandate the lowering of investment barriers. But the proposal lost  steam after the financial crises of 1997 and 1998, and its fate was ultimately sealed  by the skepticism of the U.S. Congress.
</p>
<p>The closest the world ever came to  a consensus that capital should be allowed to flow freely between countries was  in the autumn of 1998. Since then, practices have changed dramatically. The IMF  is now much more cautious about encouraging countries to liberalize their foreign  investment rules, and it often warns developing countries not to move too quickly.  The OECD has also retreated from its unqualified support for such measures. These  days, the two dominant credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's,  often warn developing states about the risks of capital liberalization, and they  have praised China and India for moving cautiously.
</p>
<p>DOHA DECLINE
</p>
<p>A similar retreat has occurred with trade  in goods and services. In the last few decades, a variety of regional agreements  have been struck in North America, South America, and Europe to promote the liberalization  of trade. The IMF, under its original mandate, has encouraged governments to eliminate  foreign exchange restrictions that hamper the growth of trade. And the WTO has been  strikingly successful in its first decade of existence as the world's primary authority  on facilitating global trade. But the organization seems to have reached the zenith  of its powers.
</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, since many of the WTO's  existing mechanisms -- especially those relating to rule enforcement -- are highly  imperfect. The problem is not with the WTO's rulings about violations of free-trade  rules; these are generally thought to be fair. The problem is that when countries  found to have broken the rules refuse to change their policies, the WTO cannot force  them to; instead, it leaves it to the country that won the dispute to take matters  into its own hands by applying WTO-sanctioned retaliatory tariffs. Not surprisingly,  this strategy tends not to work when the winner is much smaller than the loser -- especially  when the loser happens to be the United States or the EU. Indeed, U.S. and European  intransigence in the face of adverse WTO decisions has weakened overall faith in  multilateral trade regimes. Countries around the world are instead showing a new  preference for bilateral and regional trade agreements; according to The Economist,  the total number of such agreements -- 250 -- has doubled in the last ten years.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the crisis in the current  Doha Round of trade talks has highlighted another deepening divide: between rich,  developed countries and poor, developing ones. For years, developing countries have  been frustrated with the hypocrisy of U.S. and European governments, which constantly  push for greater market access while protecting their own agricultural and light-manufacturing  sectors through tariffs. Now these developing states have had enough, and the talks  have broken down, primarily because the United States and the EU have failed to  offer a constructive way forward. The damage to Doha will not necessarily be fatal.  After all, the Uruguay Round took more than seven years to complete, and behind-the-scenes  negotiations will continue. But the days of clear progress and the ever-broadening  mandate of the WTO seem long gone.
</p>
<p>Tension has also increased over the  free movement of labor. The current era of globalization has not even approached  the cosmopolitanism and openness to migration that characterized the pre-1914 phase.  According to James, who teaches at Princeton, 36 million people left Europe for  the Americas between 1871 and 1915. Nothing approaching that kind of population  shift is likely to occur today. The European public has grown highly skeptical about  the EU's ability to absorb and assimilate new immigrants from Muslim and African  countries. Indeed, even within the EU, barriers have started to go up as the union's  older members have restricted immigration from new members such as Poland, Hungary,  and Slovakia. In the United States, meanwhile, immigration -- especially the status  of the 12 million illegal immigrants already inside the country -- has become a  similarly contentious issue. President George W. Bush has, at some political cost  to his administration, proposed to address the problem through a package that would  include better border enforcement and an offer of earned citizenship for the illegal  immigrants already inside the country. But so far, Congress has failed to move any  legislation forward, and the most likely outcome appears to be the construction  of a massive fence along the border with Mexico.
</p>
<p>THE CHAMPIONS' CHANGE OF HEART
</p>
<p>One of the most worrisome aspects of the general  decline of globalization today is the growth of public skepticism and the increasing  popular dissatisfaction with the uneven distribution of globalization's benefits  both across and within countries. These sentiments, now evident virtually everywhere,  are perhaps most striking in two countries: the United States and China. In both  places, they are already starting to force policymakers to erect economic barriers.
</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--4">

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>The irony of this trend is that both the United  States and China have benefited handsomely from globalization. Yet politics in these  two states now constrain their governments from further embracing cross-border flows  of capital, goods, and labor. As Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve Board,  suggested in August 2006, the problem "arises because changes in the patterns of  production are likely to threaten the livelihoods of some workers and the profits  of some firms, even when these changes lead to greater productivity and output overall.  The natural reaction of those so affected is to resist change, for example, by seeking  the passage of protectionist measures."
</p>
<p>Consider what has recently happened  in the United States. The country is now confronted with the largest current account  deficit ever -- a deficit that necessarily must be matched by capital inflows, that  is, borrowing from abroad. And yet, just when the United States needs foreign  investors the most, popular sentiment has turned against them. In recent years,  intense public pressure has essentially forced Washington to reject two high-profile  transactions: an attempt by CNOOC, a giant Chinese oil firm, to acquire the U.S.  firm Unocal and Dubai Ports World's move to take over a British company that administered  several U.S. ports. Now, ongoing legislative efforts to reform the Committee on Foreign  Investments in the United States threaten to politicize the approval process further.  Even as the United States' need for foreign investors to finance the current account  deficit grows, members of the U.S. Congress are acting as though the country were  still in a position of strength and able to dictate the terms of such deals.
</p>
<p>Washington's commitment to the free  flow of goods -- especially Chinese goods -- has also started to falter. The Bush  administration has refused to endorse accusations by the media and legislators that  Beijing deliberately keeps its currency weak in order to boost Chinese exports.  But Congress has been far less reticent: Senators Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsey  Graham (R-S.C.) have proposed a highly punitive 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese goods,  and Senators Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) have sponsored a more  moderate (and more WTO-compliant) version. Another worrisome factor is that fast-track  trade-negotiating authority, given to the president in 2002, expires in 2007. Before  the November congressional election, Democrats announced that they would not renew  this authority if they won control of the House and the Senate -- which would make  any new trade measures that much harder to win approval for.
</p>
<p>A similar retrenchment has occurred  in China. Access to commercial banking, communications, and real estate remains  severely limited for foreign investors, and Chinese officials have started giving  more scrutiny to potential foreign investment in other sectors as well. A bid by  the private equity firm the Carlyle Group to take over China's Xugong Group Construction  Machinery Company has been held up for months, and Carlyle recently reduced its  proposed ownership share to 50 percent in an effort to limit political opposition  to the deal. Beijing also introduced measures in August 2006 to require government  review of mergers and acquisitions that could affect China's "economic security"  or that involve "key industries" or popular domestic trademarks. And a new antimonopoly  law primarily targets multinationals that the Chinese government believes have too  much market power.
</p>
<p>Underlying these moves, the very nature  of the Chinese development model has, with little fanfare, changed in recent years.  In 2005, Beijing concluded that its previous model, which had been in place since  around 1978, had been too dependent on greenfield foreign direct investment (that  is, foreign money that goes to the construction of new facilities and new technologies).  Foreign investors in China had received better tax and regulatory treatment than  domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing decided to reverse this orientation, and in November  2005, China's National Development and Reform Commission, a sort of overarching  reform ministry, accordingly issued the innocuous sounding Measure 39. Under this  regulation, domestic venture capitalists now receive much better tax and regulatory  treatment than do their foreign counterparts. China will still, to be sure, find  a place for foreign investment, but Beijing will no longer give it the protected  status it once enjoyed.
</p>
<p>Beijing, like other governments, is  also coming under increasing pressure to address the inequalities brought on by  rapid economic development and globalization. According to Chinese sources, the  richest 10 percent of households in China now account for more than 40 percent of  the country's wealth, whereas the poorest 10 percent of households account for only  about 2 percent. The regional income gap is also increasing, with coastal provinces  now enjoying a per capita gross domestic product more than ten times that of the  poorest interior provinces. President Hu Jintao has publicly recognized the need  to address these disparities by making the attainment of a "harmonious socialist  society" one of his government's central goals, and he is slowly taking measures,  such as simplifying and reducing the tax burden on farmers, to effect it.
</p>
<p>OIL OF ONE'S OWN
</p>
<p>One of the best ways to measure the health  of globalization worldwide is to look at energy markets, and those for oil in particular.  Oil has become the ultimate global commodity, unparalleled in importance. As go  oil markets, therefore, so goes the global economy. And here, too, the signs are  worrisome.
</p>
<p>Both sets of states in the oil market -- those  countries that have oil and those that do not -- have changed the way they do business  in recent years. Among the haves, the rising price of oil has increased the temptation  of governments to assert control over the resource. Throughout Latin America, governments  have reasserted their authority over extraction projects that they once had ceded  to foreign firms. Moscow has similarly muscled its way into direct control over  Russia's vast oil and gas wealth and has used that control to extend its strategic  influence.
</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>In response, a number of the oil have-nots  have taken measures to insulate themselves from a disruption in their oil supply.  This helps explain China's seemingly illogical drive to acquire stakes in oil production  facilities abroad. So long as oil remains a global commodity, consumers need not  own the means of its production; they can simply buy all they need on the world  market. China, however, seems to be preparing for a day when oil becomes far harder  to acquire and transport and has thus signed various oil and natural gas agreements  over the last five years with Angola, Brazil, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Sudan.  This strategy makes so little economic sense that it can only be explained by an  expectation that global oil markets will at some point break down, due to either  a worldwide recession or a conflict between China and the United States.
</p>
<p>SAVING GLOBALIZATION, SLOWING DOWN
</p>
<p>Globalization in its last great era, which  ended in 1914, occurred in a completely ad hoc way; that is, it lacked the institutional  foundations that have helped cross-border markets flourish during the past 30 years.  These institutional foundations may have been weakened of late, but enough rules  and organizations remain to ensure that the current global economy is unlikely to  suffer the same fate as the last. In other words, although globalization has passed  its peak, it is unlikely to unravel completely.
</p>
<p>Still, the flaws in multilateral institutions  such as the WTO and the growing discontent with globalization will make it harder  and harder for politicians to pursue free markets. If the United States, in particular,  fails to do more to ensure that the benefits and opportunities of an internationalized  economy are spread as widely as possible, there could be an even more potent backlash.
</p>
<p>This is where smart policies should  come in. The U.S. government must work harder to convince the American public -- particularly  those Americans who fear losing their jobs to international competition -- that  the costs of undermining or reversing globalization would be worse than the benefits.  There is plenty of evidence to point to. Wal-Mart, for example, may have wreaked  havoc on the U.S. retail sector with its relentlessly competitive business model,  but it has also brought American consumers declining real prices for their mobile  phones, DVD players, and televisions. Similarly, the Chinese manufacturing juggernaut  may worry some Americans, but without it there would be no lower-cost products for  Wal-Mart to sell.
</p>
<p>Washington must also do more to ensure  that theUnited States remains competitive in the global economy. Legislation has  been introduced in Congress to enact President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative,  which would double federal support for fundamental research in the physical sciences  and engineering, make the R &amp; D tax credit permanent, expand math and science  education, and ease immigration for highly skilled workers. But this legislation  has not been passed, and its fate remains uncertain. Too little has been done to  retrain workers who have lost their jobs to outsourcing. The corporate sector can  and should help, not only by publicizing the benefits of openness but also by bearing  some of the costs of the resulting dislocation.
</p>
<p>Internationally, the United States  must resist the temptation to continue down its path of ad hoc globalization. Bilateral  treaties have been an effective and convenient way to advance short-term priorities,  but they have undermined vital multilateral processes and institutions. Were Washington  to embrace the rule-based European approach, it would reinforce the institutions  that all countries depend on to preserve the gains of globalization.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as skepticism about global  markets continues to increase, U.S. corporations should prepare for rough going  in their international operations. U.S. managers may once have assumed that understanding  the politics and rules of the countries in which they traded and invested -- and  the international organizations of which those countries were members -- was a luxury.  Such knowledge is now essential, however, and U.S. business leaders should prepare  themselves for the new rules and restrictions that they will face -- and that the  United States itself is considering adopting in the wake of the CNOOC and Dubai  Ports World debacles.
</p>
<p>Other key stakeholders in the globalization  project must also do their part. The multiplicity of EU rules governing the liberalization  of markets has come to feel increasingly onerous to Europeans -- and too far removed  from those rules' original social and political purposes. Last year's constitutional  crisis was just the latest symptom of the growing public fear that the EU is causing  the marketization of daily life (as opposed to the protection of traditional European  practices). Politicians and European Commission officials must start interpreting  the EU's rules more flexibly if they are to legitimize the organization and its  integrated model in the minds of their constituents.
</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Chinese leaders face even more serious  challenges. The export-driven Chinese economy cannot survive without a flourishing  global economy fed by U.S. consumption. Beijing must therefore work to counter the  widespread hostility to China in the U.S. Congress by, for example, better protecting  intellectual property rights. China must also try to lessen income inequality at  home in order to limit the dislocation caused by globalization.
</p>
<p>If all or most of these efforts are  made, the world will no doubt find a way to muddle through. But this muddling must  not be taken for granted; it will require hard and sustained effort by U.S., European,  and Chinese leaders. Washington, especially, needs to think hard about how to sell  globalization, and not just to the U.S. public but to the world. After all, the  U.S. economy can ill afford a serious threat to the open markets on which it and,  indeed, all of us depend.
