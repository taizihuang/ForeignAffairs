<p>You enter the ghetto through a warren of decrepit  alleys crowded with locals seeking refuge from the hot night air of their cramped  homes. Suspicious stares alert you that you have entered Kingston's gangland. But  if the local don -- or "area leader," in the polite lexicon of official Jamaica -- has  granted you permission to enter, you are safe. Here, news travels like dye in water.</p>
<p>The local gang maintains its own system of  law and order, complete with a holding cell fashioned from an old chicken coop and  a street-corner court. It "taxes" local businesses in return for protecting them,  punishing those who refuse to pay with attacks on property and people. It provides  a rudimentary welfare safety net by helping locals with school fees, lunch money,  and employment -- a function that the Jamaican government used to perform. But over  the last couple of decades, keen to reduce spending, it has scaled back many of  its operations, leaving a vacuum. As one kind of authority has withdrawn, another  has advanced.</p>
<p>Jamaica's gangs -- each a fluid but  cohesive organization with a clearly demarcated territory -- fund their activities  partly through their participation in one of the industries in the vanguard of globalization:  the transshipment of illegal drugs. Although at first glance the gangs seem to be  at odds with the government, the local police frequently cooperate with the dons,  whose ruthlessly efficient rule can make the cops' jobs easier. The result is a tenuous  quid pro quo: if the dons keep order, the police turn a blind eye to the drug trade.  Besides, direct assaults on the gangs are often futile. Even when the police capture  dons or their gunmen, convictions are next to impossible to obtain because potential  witnesses remain silent out of loyalty or fear. Just as the rise of the modern state  generated conventional symbols of loyalty -- flags, anthems, national heroes -- so  does gangland culture reflect the new power structure. The dons patronize deejays  who celebrate them in song, and huge crowds turn out for the gang leaders' funerals,  waving flags that symbolize their rule.</p>
<p>Kingston's gang-controlled neighborhoods  are just one result of a growing worldwide phenomenon: the rise of private "statelets"  that coexist in a delicate, often symbiotic relationship with a larger state. Large  sections of Colombia have gone this way, as have some of Mexico's borderlands and  vast stretches of the Andes and the adjoining rain forest. Countries such as Afghanistan  and Somalia are more or less governed by warlords, and Pakistan's borderlands submit  to Islamabad only when the state's armed forces force them to. Private militias  have carved up whole swaths of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Papua New  Guinea, and at one point militias ruled the Solomon Islands. And the list is growing.</p>

</div><p>Policy debates and the academic literature  on international relations have been preoccupied lately by discussions of so-called  failed states. Not all cases in which private actors have assumed statelike functions,  however, involve chaos or failure. The gang-controlled communities in Jamaica, for  instance, are often among the safest in the country. The performance of traditional  state functions in such communities may actually have improved as the official government  has receded. Often what takes place is not so much collapse as reconfiguration -- what  some scholars have described as the emergence of a new Middle Ages. And close study  suggests that the power of statelets and other new political actors will be less  transitory, more significant, and more resistant to intervention than is usually  assumed.</p>
<p>RISE AND FALL</p>
<p>Historians invented the term "Middle Ages"  to describe the period between the fall of the Roman Empire in the late fifth century  and the rise of modern monarchies with their own new empires in the sixteenth. The  era was considered an interregnum during which Europe's tribes developed ad hoc  arrangements to manage the affairs of a suddenly anarchic world.</p>
<p>When the Pax Romana dissolved, roads and seaways  grew more dangerous. Trade declined, cities emptied, and economic activity retreated  to the countryside. In the provinces, nobles who had previously collected taxes  for Rome found themselves adrift. Some disappeared from history. Others negotiated  power-sharing arrangements with the leaders of nomadic tribes, collecting taxes  for the new overlords in return for protection. Still others, commanding their own  armed forces, simply created their own political domains.</p>
<p>Unlike the authority of the Roman nobles,  which had ultimately derived from the empire's capital city, the medieval nobility's  power was based on its direct control of land and people. Able to tax their vassals  and press them into military service, barons could resist efforts to roll back their  political and economic gains. Even when imperial forms of rule, such as the Holy  Roman Empire, reappeared, they were mostly empty shells or confederations rather  than powerful hierarchical institutions.</p>
<p>Still, Rome's fall did not simply smash  Europe into shards. Legacies of the empire's unity persisted, the most significant  of which was the Catholic Church. For centuries, the church retained the trappings  of the imperial age, including Roman architecture, the vestments of the Roman nobility,  and Latin. Outside the church, Latin disappeared as a language of commerce and administration  as it evolved into the various Romance languages or was absorbed into Germanic languages  such as English. As communication between regions diminished, the ability of people  from different regions to understand one another declined. But in monasteries, an  increasingly rarefied Latin retained its hold on the small, elite class of priest-scholars  who kept learning alive and who unified Europe's high culture as they circulated  throughout the continent. Through them, most Europeans were able to keep a foot  in two worlds: that of their lord's manor, where they spoke a local dialect and  seldom traveled farther than the village market, and that of the church, a pan-European  sphere where they spoke Latin, even if they did not always fully grasp its meaning.</p>
<p>All this fragmentation yielded the  medieval world's complex structure: highly localized economies, social systems founded  on plural identities, and a political system composed of multiple and overlapping  authorities, each drawing on an autonomous resource base. Complicating the picture  further was the fact that the resource bases themselves overlapped: kings could  tax trade, while both lords and bishops could tax production. Stability thus rested  on constant cooperation and negotiation; when these failed, the result was conflict.</p>

</div><p>What killed off the European Middle  Ages was capitalism. The modern state system dates from the Peace of Westphalia,  in 1648, which recognized that governments were sovereign over their territories  and that no institution within their borders was exempt from their rules. But medievalism  was pushed aside for good only as national economies gradually developed and centralized  governments supplanted the plethora of medieval authorities over the next couple  of centuries. The growth of cities and the advent of overseas exploration boosted  tax revenues from trade and enriched the urban middle classes. Because taxing trade  was generally a royal prerogative, the coffers of royal treasuries filled; the nobility,  which depended on revenues from agriculture, began an irreversible economic slide.  At the same time, the rising business class began to eclipse the lords politically  by filling the emergent states' bureaucracies, in which offices were often sold to  the highest bidders.</p>
<p>New developments in warfare, including  the mastery of gunpowder, favored standing military organizations over mercenary  armies and forces raised from feudal estates. The need to protect sea-lanes for  trade drove the expansion of centrally controlled navies, and "patriotic" armies  appeared on land, filled with conscripts united around new anthems and flags and  managed by large new bureaucracies. Financing these militaries required raising  new revenues, which led to the rise of increasingly centralized governments. These  governments in turn established secure borders and customs posts and sought greater  control over their (taxable) citizens. To spur continued economic growth, these  governments also ended up regulating commerce, policing cities, expanding education,  improving public health, and building and standardizing domestic infrastructure  such as roads, railways, and canals. And thus the foundations of the modern world  were laid.</p>
<p>BACK TO THE FUTURE</p>
<p>In the last decades of the twentieth century,  as capitalism began to operate on an increasingly global scale, the nation-state  and the other structures and institutions of the modern era started to fray around  the edges, leading scholars to talk of a new medievalism. The concept most often  emerged in debates about European integration, as the growing influence of the European  Union and its forerunners, the devolution of state powers to regional governments,  and the rise of assertive municipalities led some to proclaim a return to Europe's  medieval past, with its overlapping loyalties and coexisting local and transnational  identities. On closer inspection, however, the concept applies less well to Europe  than to the developing world, where the spread of modernity has often been curtailed  before it has gone very far.</p>
<p>With the demise of European colonialism, the  governments of many newly independent countries in the developing world tried to  bring the fruits of modernity to -- and thereby win the loyalty of -- their people,  who in some cases had not even heard of the countries in which they lived. (Even  today, there are Indian villages whose inhabitants remain unaware of the existence  of "India.") States tried to consolidate their sovereignty with a carrot-and-stick  approach. They cracked down on ethnic and regional movements that contested the  state's legitimacy, producing violent episodes such as the Biafra War in Nigeria  and India's invasions of the princely states. Simultaneously, they sought to seduce  their citizens by providing them with employment, patronage, education, and health  care.</p>
<p>Although this model of the state as  patronage provider worked for a while, it was expensive and ultimately unsustainable.  From the 1970s onward, the globalization of capital markets forced all governments  to compete internationally for investment, pressuring them to reduce their deficits,  taxes, and expenditures. New theories of public management prodded rich and poor  states alike to reduce their role in the economy by using private and semiprivate  contractors to deliver many services. And in developing countries, change often  came simply as a result of fiscal necessity: governments ran out of resources and  had to adjust to leaner times through cutbacks in public services. Such retrenchment  may have been efficient, but it was also highly visible and seen as regressive by  these governments' populations -- a perception compounded by their ubiquitous tendency  to use sales taxes to shift the tax burden from highly mobile capital and skilled  labor to less mobile taxpayers.</p>
<p>Wandering through many cities of the  developing world today, one comes up against the limits of modernity. Vast metropolises,  growing so quickly their precise populations are unknown, are dotted with shantytowns  and squatter camps that lack running water, are crisscrossed by open gutters of  raw sewage, and are powered by stolen electricity. Developing states are constantly  struggling to catch up. In some places, they succeed, barely. In others, they are  losing control of chunks of their territory.</p>
<p>Many of Rio de Janeiro's favelas, for  example, are now so dangerous that politicians enter only with the local gang leader's  permission. The gangs deliver votes in exchange for patronage. Beyond that, politicians  and the state remain largely invisible and irrelevant. The gangs do not wish to  secede from Brazil, but they can compel its government to negotiate the terms of  its sovereignty. As a result, gang-controlled communities remain safe zones for  the transshipment of drugs from the Andes to the world at large. The gangs demonstrate,  almost celebrate, their independence and defiance of authority at raucous late-night  dances patrolled by local cadres. Such warlordism would have been familiar to the  western Europeans of a millennium ago.</p>
<p>Still, although the weakness of the  state today is most pronounced in the developing world, the state's retreat is also  a global phenomenon. The sovereignty of states was consolidated when they gained  control over their territories and populations and secured the exclusive right to  tax their output. As economic activity has become increasingly detached from particular  local contexts, however, the state's ability to tax production has waned. And so  the "barons" of the new global political economy are growing less and less constrained.</p>

</div><p>The shift toward knowledge-intensive  products, reductions in the transport costs of both goods and labor, and the rapid  acceleration of technological change have loosened the state's hold on its traditional  resource base. At the end of the Middle Ages, states assumed the role of intermediaries  between the local and world economies. But today's postmodern economy comprises  not centralized national economies operating under state guidance, but small, fragmented,  and increasingly autonomous economic units that are increasingly capable of evading  state control. What is emerging is a global economy increasingly centered on what  some theorists have called "global cities" -- major urban centers that are connected  less to their hinterlands and more to their counterparts elsewhere.</p>
<p>Because neoliberal policies have done  more to free the movement of capital and goods and services than to reduce barriers  to human migration, the balance of negotiating power has shifted in favor of the  managers of multinational or even global firms. In many countries, this has skewed  the distribution of income, leading to the emergence of pockets of vast wealth and  areas of abject poverty. As the more prosperous players plug into a global economy  and their production relies ever less on local labor, they retreat into secure enclaves  protected by private security forces -- a process former U.S. Secretary of Labor  Robert Reich has called the "secession of the successful." Marginalized communities  have essentially done the same thing, using a different kind of private security  force -- the gang -- to maintain order in the global cities' multiplying and expanding  ghettos.</p>
<p>MIND THE GAP</p>
<p>There has long been a chasm between the planet's  rich and poor. What is unusual about the income gap today is that it has widened  just as dramatic improvements in communications technology have filtered down to  even the most impoverished villages. The world's poorest citizens are thus more  exposed than ever before to images of how the richest people live, creating an expectations  gap between what states can offer and what their citizens demand. The gap has often  been filled by private agents, who are more flexible than states and better positioned  to exploit current opportunities. In the cities of the developing world, groups  ranging from criminal gangs to Islamist civil-society networks have assumed many  of the functions that states have abandoned, funding their operations through informal  taxes as well as with proceeds from the drug trade, human trafficking, and money laundering.</p>
<p>Violence, too, has been increasingly privatized.  The "peace dividend" from the end of the Cold War released millions of people from  armed service but left in place much of the infrastructure of violence. Demobilized  soldiers and fighters who once served in the proxy armies maintained by the superpowers  during the Cold War (guerrilla forces, "national liberation movements," and the  like) have gravitated toward mercenary armies, militias, and gangs and now provide  security forces for the "new nobility," such as Kingston's dons and the residents  of gated communities.</p>
<p>In the postmodern economy, the distinction  between formal and informal sectors has blurred. Nonstate actors forge networks  linking global cities so as to create a highly adaptive economy that exists largely  beyond states' notice. The narcotics trade, for example, uses the lines of communication  between the homelands of immigrants from Jamaica, Colombia, and elsewhere and the  markets of their new, rich countries of residence. These paths are highly flexible,  as demonstrated by the ability of drug gangs to redirect shipments along circuitous  routes as soon as one course is blocked. And such paths are not only open to criminals.  Resourceful Somali expatriates revived the ancient institution of hawala in order  to send money to relatives back home, where the government had collapsed. Later,  of course, al Qaeda adapted the system to fund its operations.</p>
<p>The new medievalism, it should be noted,  is not always malignant or violent. In many sub-Saharan African countries, for example,  the postcolonial state never succeeded in implanting itself deeply in the day-to-day  lives of its citizens, let alone their consciousness. In such lands, the state's  retreat has led to the reactivation of "traditional" political actors such as ethnic  communities and religious brotherhoods. Islamist brotherhoods in Dakar, for example,  collect voluntary contributions from large networks of overseas Senegalese, which  they then use to support their clients in Dakar's poor quarters.</p>
<p>People everywhere, finally, are leaving  behind national symbols and cultures and turning to local and global hybrids. In  Dakar, French, the language of the elite, is being displaced by the local tongue  of Wolof and hip-hop lingo from the United States. A similar trend is happening  in Jamaica, where English is losing ground to the local patois, accompanied by language  derived from dancehall reggae and rap. And so the coexistence of local and transnational  identities that typified the European Middle Ages has reappeared.</p>

</div><p>Given the extent of U.S. primacy, it has become  a commonplace to compare today's United States to the Roman Empire. The comparison  might be telling in unexpected ways. After all, the Roman Empire did not fall to  another empire; all of its "peer competitors" had long since been dispatched when  it collapsed. Nor, historians are now concluding, did it fall as a result of internal  decline, whether cultural, spiritual, or economic. Rather, the empire fell because  barbarian tribes gnawed at its edges and eventually toppled its core. Its sheer  wealth set it apart from the petty kingdoms on its frontiers, which, denied access  to Rome's riches, grew resentful, envious, and finally obstreperous, bringing the  mighty low through the death of a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Today, pundits writing about the future of  the U.S. empire tend to adopt an inward-looking approach similar to that of earlier  generations of historians of the Roman Empire. For example, scholars debate topics  such as whether the U.S. economy can bear the cost of maintaining so many overseas  military and diplomatic operations. But they tend to neglect the vast portion of  humanity kept at bay beyond the empire's borders, who regard it with the same mixture  of awe, longing, and bitterness with which the barbarians once regarded the Eternal  City.</p>
<p>As states recede and the new medievalism  advances, the outside world is destined to move increasingly beyond the control -- and  even the understanding -- of the new Rome. The globe's variegated informal and quasi-informal  statelike activities will continue to expand, as will the power and reach of those  who live by them. The new Romans, like the old, might not enjoy the consequences.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110403/ajax/content?token=G0m1m7FPdlC0CjE5TBmMQqd2pAv6NpR1BnH5oW2OKGo" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
