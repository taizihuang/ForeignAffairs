<p>Terrorism and the war in Iraq are not the only  sources of the American public's anxiety about U.S. foreign policy. Americans are  also concerned about their country's dependence on foreign energy supplies, U.S.  jobs moving overseas, Washington's seeming inability to stop illegal immigration,  and a wide range of other issues. The public's support for promoting democracy abroad  has also seriously eroded.</p>
<p>These are a few of the highlights from the  second in a continuing series of surveys monitoring Americans' confidence in U.S.  foreign policy conducted by the nonprofit research organization Public Agenda (with  support from the Ford Foundation), of which I am chair. The first survey, conducted  in June of last year, found that only the war in Iraq had reached the "tipping point" -- the  moment at which a large portion of the public begins to demand that the government  address its concerns. According to this follow-on survey, conducted among a representative  sample of 1,000 American adults in mid-January 2006, a second issue has reached  that status. The U.S. public has grown impatient with U.S. dependence on foreign  countries for oil, and its impatience could soon translate into a powerful demand  that Washington change its policies.</p>
<p>Overall, the public's confidence in  U.S. foreign policy has drifted downward since the first survey. On no issue did  the government's policy receive an improved rating from the public in January's  survey, and on a few the ratings changed for the worse. The public has become less  confident in Washington's ability to achieve its goals in Iraq and Afghanistan,  hunt down terrorists, protect U.S. borders, and safeguard U.S. jobs. Fifty-nine  percent of those surveyed said they think that U.S. relations with the rest of the  world are on the wrong track (compared to 37 percent who think the opposite), and  51 percent said they are disappointed by the country's relations with other countries  (compared to 42 percent who are proud of them).</p>
<p>As for the goal of spreading democracy  to other countries, only 20 percent of respondents identified it as "very important" -- the  lowest support noted for any goal asked about in the survey. Even among Republicans,  only three out of ten favored pursuing it strongly. In fact, most of the erosion  in confidence in the policy of spreading democracy abroad has occurred among Republicans,  especially the more religious wing of the party. People who frequently attend religious  services have been among the most ardent supporters of the government's policies,  but one of the recent survey's most striking findings is that although these people  continue to maintain a high level of trust in the president and his administration,  their support for the government's Iraq policy and for the policy of exporting democracy  has cooled.</p>

</div>
</div><p>A question always hovers in the background  whenever public attitudes on foreign policy are reported: What influence do shifts  in such attitudes have on the actual day-to-day conduct of foreign policy? Unlike  for domestic policy, where it is clear that public opinion is always relevant, for  foreign policy it is often difficult to understand whether changes in public opinion  lead to changes on the ground.</p>
<p>The reason for this murkiness is that the  public grants the president and Congress far more authority for decision-making  on foreign policy than on domestic affairs. Americans assume that the president and  his advisers have special information about international relations to which they  are not privy. Some Americans may also lack confidence in their ability to judge  the wisdom of particular foreign policies. All of this translates into a good deal  of leeway for policymakers. Still, the public puts limits on this freedom and sometimes  takes it away abruptly. Under certain conditions, public opinion can have a decisive  influence. The trick is understanding what those conditions are.</p>
<p>In mid-2005, we found that in addition  to the war in Iraq, three other issues were moving toward the tipping point, where  public opinion would become strong enough to influence policy. These issues were  the outsourcing of jobs to other countries, illegal immigration, and the United  States' deteriorating relations with the Muslim world. Based on the January survey,  concern over outsourcing and illegal immigration has grown a bit more intense, and  the worry about the growing hatred of the United States in Muslim countries has  modestly receded. On the other hand, U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources,  which was not an urgent issue in mid-2005, has leapt to the forefront of the public's  consciousness.</p>
<p>In studies that track attitudes, there  are always more views that do not change than views that do. This survey is no exception.  It is a striking -- and encouraging -- illustration of the public's thoughtfulness  and consistency. Respondents still awarded the government high marks (an A or a  B) on its performance in achieving foreign policy goals such as helping other nations  when natural disasters strike and making sure the United States has a strong and  well-supplied military. Respondents continued to believe that the government deserves  intermediate ratings on its efforts to make peace between the Israelis and  the Palestinians and help improve the lives of people in the developing world. And  respondents still gave the government failing grades on issues such as stopping  the importation of illegal drugs. This context of overall stability makes any changes  in opinion that the survey did find all the more striking and significant.</p>
<p>The war in Iraq, already at the tipping  point in mid-2005, remains the primary foreign policy issue on which public pressure  continues to mount. Although illegal immigration and outsourcing moved closer to  the tipping point in the January 2006 poll, neither has actually reached it. In  contrast, the public's concern over U.S. relations with the Muslim world moved slightly  away from the tipping point. And the issue of energy dependence, which had ranked  far down the list, leapfrogged ahead to move into tipping-point territory.</p>
<p>No change is more striking than that  relating to the public's opinion of U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Americans have  grown much more worried that problems abroad may affect the price of oil. The proportion  of those who said they "worry a lot" about this occurring has increased from 42  percent to 55 percent. Nearly nine out of ten Americans asked were worried about  the problem -- putting oil dependence at the top of our 18-issue "worry scale."  Virtually all Americans surveyed (90 percent) said they see the United States' lack  of energy independence as jeopardizing the country's security, 88 percent said they  believe that problems abroad could endanger the United States' supply of oil and  so raise prices for U.S. consumers, and 85 percent said they believe that the U.S.  government would be capable of doing something about the problem if it tried. This  last belief may be the reason that only 20 percent of those surveyed gave the government  an A or a B on this issue; three-quarters assigned the government's performance  a C, a D, or an F.</p>

</div>
</div><p>The oil-dependency issue now meets  all the criteria for having reached the tipping point: an overwhelming majority  expresses concern about the issue, the intensity of the public's unease has reached  significant levels, and the public believes the government is capable of addressing  the issue far more effectively than it has until now. Should the price of gasoline  drop over the coming months, this issue may temporarily lose some of its political  weight. But with supplies of oil tight and geopolitical tensions high, public pressure  is likely to grow.</p>
<p>The only other issue that has reached  the tipping point is the war in Iraq. It continues to be the foreign policy issue  foremost in the public's mind, and respondents consistently deem the war (along  with the threat of terrorism) to be the most important problem facing the United  States in its dealings with the rest of the world. Concern about mounting U.S. casualties  in Iraq is particularly widespread -- 82 percent of respondents to the June 2005  survey said they cared deeply about the issue; in January 2006, 83 percent said  they did. Although the level and intensity of concern about Iraq has remained fairly  stable, the public's appraisal of how well the United States is meeting its objectives  there has eroded slightly. Last summer, 39 percent of respondents gave the government  high marks on this issue; 33 percent did in January. The erosion, moreover, comes  almost entirely from Republicans: 61 percent gave the government an A or a B on  Iraq in the first survey, but only 53 percent did in the second. Confidence in U.S.  policy on Iraq is also down significantly among those who regularly attend religious  services, who also show rising levels of concern about casualties.</p>
<p>One reason for the downward trend is  skepticism about how truthful Washington has been about the reasons for invading  Iraq. Fifty percent of respondents said they feel that they were misled -- the highest  level of mistrust measured in the survey. Another source of skepticism may be more  troublesome for the government: only 22 percent of Americans surveyed said they  feel that their government has the ability to create a democracy in Iraq.</p>
<p>WHAT'S ON DECK</p>
<p>Three other issues are approaching the tipping  point but have not yet reached it: the outsourcing of jobs, illegal immigration,  and U.S. relations with the rest of the world, and especially Muslim countries.</p>
<p>An impressive 87 percent of respondents expressed  some degree of concern about outsourcing, 52 percent said they "worry a lot" about  it, and 81 percent of respondents gave the government poor grades (a C, a D, or  an F) on its handling of the issue. Thus, outsourcing now meets two of the three  criteria for reaching the tipping point. But it falls short on the third criterion,  the ability of the government to take effective action on the issue. Most Americans  surveyed (74 percent) felt that it was unlikely that U.S. companies would keep jobs  in the country when labor is cheaper elsewhere. And 52 percent of respondents believed  it was unrealistic to think that the government could do anything to stop corporations  from sending jobs abroad. On the other hand, a large plurality (44 percent) said  they believe the U.S. government could do a lot to prevent jobs from moving overseas  if it really tried. Should this plurality become a majority -- which we suspect  will happen during 2006 -- outsourcing will have reached the tipping point.</p>
<p>Concern about illegal immigration has  also grown. Two out of five Americans surveyed (41 percent) said they "worry a lot"  about this issue, and half (50 percent) said they believe that tighter controls  on immigration would greatly enhance U.S. security. Almost half (48 percent) also  said they believe the government could do a lot to slow illegal immigration, and  respondents gave Washington even lower grades on protecting U.S. borders in the  most recent survey than they did in mid-2005.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the public's feelings  on a third issue have moved in the opposite direction. This issue is the intangible  but important question of U.S. relations with the rest of the world, and specifically  with Muslim countries. During the period between the two surveys, the U.S. public  grew marginally less worried about anti-Americanism in the Muslim world and elsewhere.  The number of respondents who said they "worry a lot" about growing hatred of the  United States in the Muslim world decreased from 40 percent to 34 percent, and the  share of those who were deeply concerned about losing the trust of people in other  countries declined from 40 percent to 29 percent, one of the larger changes in the  survey. The reasons for these changes are not self-evident. The sense of shame about  the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, so strong in 2005, seems to have receded  with the passage of time.</p>
<p>Only about a third of Americans surveyed  (35 percent) said they think the U.S. government could do a lot to establish good  relations with moderate Muslims -- but almost two-thirds (64 percent) nevertheless  gave the government poor marks because of its failure to do so. We expect opinions  on this issue to be volatile in the future. Nearly a third of respondents said they  "worry a lot" about the rise of Islamic extremism around the world (31 percent)  and the possibility that U.S. actions in the Middle East have aided the recruitment  of terrorists (33 percent). Almost half (45 percent) said they believe that Islam  encourages violence, and survey respondents estimated that about half or more of  all Muslims in the world are anti-American. But a clear majority (56 percent) continued  to have confidence that improved communications with the Muslim world would reduce  hatred of the United States.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Americans may also be getting used  to the once-shocking notion that they are not well loved abroad. A majority of respondents  (65 percent) have realized that the rest of the world sees the United States in  a negative light. When Americans are asked to describe the image of the United States  in other countries, the results show a great deal of ambivalence and confusion.  Even though a majority said they believe the United States is seen negatively,  large majorities ascribed positive elements to the country's image abroad. Four  out of five respondents said they think the United States is seen as "a free and  democratic country" (81 percent) and "a country of opportunity for everyone" (80  percent). Nearly as many said they believe the United States is seen as generous  to other countries (72 percent) and as a strong leader (69 percent). But equal numbers  said the United States is seen as "arrogant" (74 percent), "pampered and spoiled"  (73 percent), "a bully" (63 percent), and a "country to be feared" (63 percent).</p>
<p>UNITY AND DIVISION</p>
<p>The U.S. public holds a strikingly clear view  of what Washington's foreign policy priorities should be. The goals the public highlights  range widely. Those that receive the most public support are helping other nations  when they are struck by natural disasters (71 percent), cooperating with other countries  on problems such as the environment and disease control (70 percent), and supporting  UN peacekeeping (69 percent). A surprisingly high level of support shows up for  goals that represent the United States' humanitarian (as distinct from its political)  ideals, such as improving the treatment of women in other countries (57 percent),  helping people in poor countries get an education (51 percent), and helping countries  move out of poverty (40 percent). Receiving less support are goals such as encouraging  U.S. businesses to invest in poor countries (22 percent). And receiving the least  support is "actively creating democracies in other countries" (20 percent).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there are partisan differences  over what the United States' goals should be. The largest gap between Republicans  and Democrats relates to "initiating military force only when we have the support  of our allies." Almost two-thirds of Democrats surveyed (64 percent) endorsed this  multilateralist principle, in contrast to slightly more than a third of Republicans  (36 percent). There are no significant differences between Republicans and Democrats  on humanitarian ideals. The parties do differ, however, on the desirability of promoting  democracy in other countries (30 percent of Republicans surveyed supported this  goal, compared to only 16 percent of Democrats). But even a majority of Republicans  have little stomach for this priority of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>This last point merits some elaboration.  A majority of the U.S. public supports the ideal of spreading democracy (53 percent  of respondents said they believe that "when more countries become democratic there  will be less conflict"), but Americans are skeptical that an activist U.S. policy  can contribute much to this outcome. A majority of those surveyed (58 percent) said  they feel that "democracy is something that countries only come to on their own."  As such skepticism grows, support for trying to create democracies abroad declines.  In the 2005 survey, 50 percent of respondents thought that the United States was  doing well at that task; in the more recent survey, the number fell to 46 percent,  and only 22 percent said they believe that Washington can do a lot to build a democratic  Iraq.</p>
<p>The 2005 survey described the huge  gap that divided Republicans and Democrats on most aspects of foreign policy. The  most recent survey found that partisan differences remain pronounced. The gap between  the parties is at its widest with regard to how the United States is doing in its  foreign policy and how much the Bush administration can be trusted. The most striking  difference is in the expression of pride in the nation's foreign policy, with a whopping  58-point spread between the percentage of Republicans and the percentage of Democrats  who believe that there is "plenty to be proud of" in U.S. dealings with the world.  Essentially, Republicans think the country is doing well in foreign policy, whereas  Democrats think it is failing miserably.</p>
<p>But digging into the numbers reveals  that although Republicans generally endorse the country's current foreign policy,  they share with Democrats a critical appraisal on a number of specific issues. Both  groups are reluctant to give an A or a B to the government for its efforts to stop  illegal immigration, achieve energy independence, block drugs from entering the  country, limit the extent of foreign debt, or negotiate beneficial trade agreements.</p>
<p>BACK TO THE FOLD?</p>
<p>The first survey showed a remarkable parallel  between the views of Republican respondents and the views of those respondents who  said they frequently attend religious services. (By "religious services," we mean  services of any kind -- in churches, synagogues, mosques, or elsewhere.) The second  survey showed reduced enthusiasm for some of the administration's policies among  devoted service attendees, especially regarding the war in Iraq. In fact, most of  the erosion in confidence in the government's foreign policy in the seven months  between the two surveys came from this source. Although there are still striking  differences between the views of Americans who do not attend religious services frequently  and the views of those who do, the gap has started to narrow, suggesting reduced  polarization on the basis of religion.</p>
<div class="dfp-tag-wrapper my-3 text-center"><div id="js-dfp-tag-speedbump-mobile--5">
<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>In the first survey, a minority of frequent  attendees at religious services (45 percent) expressed serious worry about casualties  in Iraq, compared to 56 percent of the total sample. Now that number has increased  to 52 percent, closer to the proportion of the population as a whole, which has  remained at 56 percent. Although people who frequently attend religious services  are still the respondents most supportive of U.S. policy in Iraq, fewer of them  (41 percent of those surveyed) gave a high grade to the government on meeting U.S.  objectives there than did seven months earlier (46 percent). In the first survey,  32 percent of those who frequently attend religious services said they worried a  lot that the war in Iraq was taking up too much money and attention; in January,  40 percent did. Almost half of those surveyed in June 2005 (48 percent) said they  believed that the United States could help other countries become democracies; in  January, that number had dropped to 37 percent, in line with the 36 percent of the  general population. And in the more recent surveys only 46 percent agreed that the  United States was "generally doing the right thing" in its relations with the rest  of the world, down from 52 percent in the earlier survey.</p>
<p>These are not big changes, but they  follow a consistent pattern, suggesting that the most actively religious Americans  are starting to react more like the rest of the public. This conclusion is supported  by the results of the broad overview question asking whether U.S. foreign policy  is going in the right or the wrong direction: 57 percent of those who frequently  attend religious services said the latter in January, matching the 58 percent of  the rest of the population who said this. Still, despite the mounting reservations  of actively religious Americans about some policies, a majority (54 percent) continue  to trust the government to tell them the truth about the country's relations with  others, in contrast to the 37 percent of respondents who do not frequently attend  religious services.</p>
<p>A recent survey of public opinion in  Arab countries, conducted in late 2005 by Zogby International and University of  Maryland Professor Shibley Telhami, showed results that are dismaying from the United  States' point of view, with large majorities believing that the war with Iraq will  make Iraqis worse off and the region less peaceful, breed more terrorism, and worsen  the prospects for settling the Arab-Israeli dispute. Comparably large majorities  said they consider U.S. foreign policies to be driven not by a desire to spread  democracy, but by oil, a quest to dominate the Middle East, the goal of protecting  Israel, or a desire to weaken the Muslim world.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one ray of light shines  through. Asked what the primary motivation for Bush's Middle East policy is, only  13 percent of those Arabs surveyed in the Zogby/Telhami poll cited "the need to  spread ... Christian religious convictions"; most (61 percent) chose instead  "the pursuit of [the United States'] national interest." Why does this offer grounds  for hope? Because our most recent survey showed that the religious divide over U.S.  foreign policy seems to be narrowing, and the Zogby/Telhami survey revealed a similar  finding: that the Arab world sees secular, rather than religious, motivations as  crucial to U.S. foreign policy. However difficult differences rooted in interests might  be to solve, and however long it might take to solve them, clashes rooted in identity  and religion are even more problematic and take far longer to surmount.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110404/ajax/content?token=CBTGFYaGhEMbZC6gDNG8jcCH0hPitGlw8VX3X3vIzcQ" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
