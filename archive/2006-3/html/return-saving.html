<div class="article-dropcap--inner paywall-content"><p>THE U.S. SAVINGS RATE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY</p>
<p>The savings rate of American households has been  declining for more than a decade and recently turned negative. This decrease has  dramatically reduced total national savings despite a rise in corporate saving.  In 2003 and 2004, the combined net savings of households, businesses, and government  were only about one percent of gross national income -- the lowest level in at least  50 years.</p>
<p>This sharp decline in saving has had important  implications for the United States and for the global economy. It has reduced productivity-enhancing  net business investment in the United States to less than four percent of GDP  and made the United States increasingly dependent on capital from the rest of the  world to finance that investment. At the same time, the decreased national savings  rate -- and the increase in consumer spending that it implies -- has induced a rise  in U.S. imports. Those imports have contributed to the growth of output and employment  in many countries around the world.</p>
<p>The downward trend in U.S. household  saving will likely soon be reversed. In the long term, a substantial rise in household  saving will have a positive effect on the U.S. economy. But the initial effects will  pose problems for the United States and its trading partners. If these effects are  not managed well, the result could be declines in output and employment and a corresponding  rise in U.S. protectionism.</p>

</div><p>To appreciate the significance of these developments,  it is helpful to have a more precise definition of net household savings. Household  saving is the difference between what households receive in after-tax income (including  wages, salaries, fringe benefits, interest, and dividends) and what they spend on  goods and services. Those savings can take the form of bank deposits, purchases  of financial assets such as stocks and bonds, or investments in real assets such  as homes and unincorporated businesses. Contributions to individual retirement accounts  (IRAs) and 401(k) plans as well as employer contributions to defined-benefit  pension plans are also counted as household savings. So too is money used to pay  down a mortgage or other loan. Borrowing is counted against saving, unless the borrowed  funds are used to purchase financial assets or are converted into other types of  savings.</p>
<p>Individuals in their 40s and 50s tend to save  money, whereas many in their 60s and beyond are "dissavers," people who are spending  the assets that they accumulated in their working years. A negative U.S. net household  savings rate implies that the saving of the savers is less than the dissaving of  the dissavers. Net household savings in the United States fell from an already low  1.7 percent in 2004 to -1 percent in the second half of 2005. This low and declining  savings rate stands in sharp contrast to the rate until the mid-1990s: 7 percent  or higher, which was enough to finance most investment in business infrastructure  and equipment and in housing.</p>
<p>That household saving has declined  should come as no surprise. The rising prices of stocks and homes have made many  Americans much wealthier. Despite the fall of the stock market in 2000, average  share prices have more than doubled in the past decade. Housing prices have risen  by more than 12 percent in the past year alone, and the total value of the real  estate owned by households has risen by more than 50 percent in less than five years,  an increase of more than $6 trillion. Between 2000 and the start of 2005, the overall  net worth of the household sector increased by nearly $7 trillion.</p>
<p>As a result, many individuals in their  40s and 50s looked at the value of their IRAs, 401(k) accounts, and homes and  rightly concluded that they did not have to save as much for their retirement as  they would have had to in the past. And so they started saving less and spending  more. Similarly, retirees looked at their substantial stock-market and housing wealth  and concluded that they could dissave much more than previous retirees. This combination  of saving less and dissaving more produced the substantial decline in the net savings  rate.</p>
<p>The increase in consumer spending as  a result of increased wealth has been reinforced by the process of mortgage refinancing.  As mortgage interest rates have come down from nearly eight percent in the mid-1990s  to less than six percent, individuals have been able to increase the size of their  mortgages without having to raise their monthly mortgage payments. Although some  of the extra mortgage borrowing has been converted into other savings, much of it  has been used to finance additional consumption. The amounts involved have been  enormous. In the past five years, the value of U.S. home mortgage debt has increased  by nearly $3 trillion. In 2004 alone, it increased by almost $1 trillion. Net mortgage  borrowing not used for the purchase of new homes that year amounted to nearly $600  billion, or almost seven percent of disposable personal income.</p>
<p>DEPENDENCY THEORY</p>
<p>Why is the decline of saving significant for  the economy? Household savings matter because those funds have traditionally been  used to finance business investment in equipment, software, and buildings, and this  investment increases productivity, the rate of economic growth, and the future standard  of living. Although the rise in household wealth that comes from higher stock and  real estate prices feels like "saving" to individual households, it does not free  up resources to increase investment in business capital. The low savings rate has  thus forced the United States to become increasingly dependent on funds from the  rest of the world to finance domestic business investment. Such capital inflows  now finance more than three-quarters of U.S. net investment.</p>

</div><p>U.S. dependence on foreign capital has increased  very rapidly in recent years. The rate of net capital inflows in 2005 was more than  twice that of 2001 and five times as much as that of 1997. Although American investors  send capital abroad to buy foreign stocks and bonds and invest in overseas businesses,  the flow of foreign capital to the United States has increased much more rapidly  than U.S. investment abroad. Net inflows have grown from 1.7 percent of GDP in  1997 to an unprecedented 5.7 percent of U.S. GDP in 2004 and more than 6.4 percent  in 2005.</p>
<p>Foreign investors are able to get the  dollars to finance these inflows of capital to the United States because Americans  import more goods and services from the rest of the world than they export. When  Americans buy something that is made abroad, they pay in dollars; when they sell  something to foreign buyers, they earn some of those dollars back. In 2004, U.S.  purchases from the rest of the world exceeded U.S. export sales by $618 billion.  Americans also made various other net transfers to the rest of the world (including  personal remittances, net interest and dividend payments, and government grants)  of $51 billion. Combining the two yields the total current account deficit of $669  billion. That amount -- 5.7 percent of GDP -- is the total value of net capital  inflows that came to the United States from the rest of the world in 2004.</p>
<p>This basic accounting identity -- that  the current account deficit is the amount of capital inflows to the United States -- links  the U.S. trade imbalance to U.S. dependence on foreign capital. Accordingly, the  United States can reduce its dependence on foreign capital inflows only if it reduces  its current account deficit. Doing so will require a slowdown in the growth of consumer  spending.</p>
<p>The relatively rapid increase in consumer  spending in the past decade and a half, and the resulting decline in the savings  rate, is the primary reason for the large trade deficit and the associated capital  inflows. But capital inflows have been possible only because foreign countries are  willing suppliers of those funds. Low U.S. savings relative to U.S. business investment  is necessarily mirrored by high savings relative to business investment in other  countries. Their savings end up as investment in the United States rather than in  other countries because of the United States' large consumer-driven trade deficit.</p>
<p>OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY</p>
<p>The flow of funds to the United States should  be a matter of concern not only because it has increased so rapidly but also because  those funds now come in what may prove to be a much less sustainable form. In the  late 1990s, most of the capital that flowed into the United States came in the form  of equity investment by private investors buying stock in U.S. companies or buying  U.S. companies outright. These private investors diversified their investments by  moving into the U.S. market because they thought the potential equity returns in  the United States were favorable in comparison to the risks. Now, in contrast, the  flow of equity investment to the United States is very small -- often less than  the equity investment that Americans make in the rest of the world. Today, the capital  inflows to the United States primarily go toward purchasing bonds and making bank  deposits, including very sizable deposits by foreign governments at the Federal  Reserve.</p>
<p>It is not clear how much of the overall capital  inflow is coming from foreign governments and how much from private investors. The  available data do not distinguish between purchases by banks on behalf of private  investors and purchases by banks on behalf of foreign governments. But extensive  conversations with officials and private bankers suggest that an overwhelming share  of the foreign capital inflows in recent years has come from foreign governments  or from institutions acting on their behalf. Such a change, from private investment  in U.S. equities to government purchases of U.S. debt, could make the continued  flow of funds less reliable.</p>
<p>Initially, foreign governments invested  in dollar assets in order to increase their foreign exchange reserves, especially  after the Asian financial crises in the late 1990s. South Korea now has more than  $200 billion of official foreign exchange reserves (invested primarily in dollar bonds),  Taiwan has more than $250 billion, and China has more than $800 billion. As a result,  these countries no longer have to fear a speculative attack on their currencies  or the possibility of being forced to accept an unwanted International Monetary  Fund program. These large dollar reserves are also the result of the polices of  these and other emerging-market countries to keep their currencies undervalued as  a way of keeping their products relatively inexpensive and thus promoting exports.</p>
<p>Since governments do not make investment  decisions by simply balancing risk and return the way private investors do, it is  particularly difficult to anticipate their future behavior. How long will foreign  governments want to keep running large current account surpluses and investing those  surpluses in relatively low-yield foreign bonds? And how will they respond to developments  in the United States or in the global economy in the future? These unanswerable  questions add to the overall uncertainty of the global economic outlook.</p>

</div><p>TRADING PLACES</p>
<p>What can be safely anticipated is that the  savings rate of American households will start to increase. It is not clear when  that increase will begin, but household saving cannot continue indefinitely at a  zero or negative level. Saving will begin to rise because the forces that have promoted  rapid consumption growth and depressed saving over the past decade will not continue.  Share prices are not likely to double again in the next decade, nor will housing  prices continue to rise at double-digit rates. Accordingly, households will be able  to increase their wealth for retirement and other purposes only by reducing the  growth of their spending so that it is less than the growth of their after-tax incomes -- that  is, by saving more.</p>
<p>Most important, mortgage interest rates have  stopped falling, bringing an end to the dissaving that occurred when homeowners  simultaneously reduced their monthly mortgage payments and extracted massive amounts  of cash simply by refinancing their mortgages. This suggests that there will be  a relatively rapid rise in the savings rate.</p>
<p>This coming rise in household saving  will eventually be good for the U.S. economy. It will make the United States less  dependent on capital from the rest of the world and permit American businesses to  raise the rate of investment in the equipment, software, and structures that increase  productivity and the future standard of living. But a higher U.S. savings rate will  also pose a challenge for the rest of the world, because it will mean a reduction  in the exports to and an increase in the imports from the United States.</p>
<p>This shift will be true even for countries,  such as those in western Europe, that do not currently have a trade surplus with  the United States. It will reduce the overall aggregate demand and employment in  countries that trade with the United States. To prepare for the inevitable rise  in the U.S. savings rate, those countries should start planning ways to stimulate  their output and employment. The fact that the United States is not the only country  in which rising asset prices have caused a sharp fall in saving over the past decade  only adds to the urgency of such planning -- since the savings rates of those countries  are also likely to rise, with similar consequences.</p>
<p>The coming rise in the U.S. savings  rate could temporarily cause a serious problem for the U.S. economy as well. As  consumer spending falls, GDP and employment will also decline. This decline will  last until net exports increase by an equal amount. If markets function well, the  higher savings rate will quickly put downward pressure on real interest rates, causing  the dollar to become more competitive -- until the rise in exports and the decline  in imports return total GDP to its full employment level. However, there is the  danger of a time lag between when the savings rate rises and when the U.S. trade  deficit declines. Such a lag would cause a slowdown in the growth of output and  employment, potentially leading to a recession.</p>
<p>This downturn would be exacerbated  if foreign governments restricted imports from the United States or prevented the  natural downward adjustment of the dollar exchange rate. The political response  in the United States could easily be the imposition of protectionist policies, including  tariffs and quotas on imports.</p>
<p>Foreign governments would thus do well  to anticipate the coming rise in the U.S. savings rate. By permitting more exchange  rate adjustment, foreign governments could mitigate the adverse cyclical effects  in the United States of a higher U.S. savings rate. Because it takes time for trade  flows to respond to exchange rate adjustments, it would be best to allow exchange  rates to adjust before the U.S. savings rate rises. Equally important, the United  States' trading partners must find ways to increase their domestic demand in order  to maintain their output and employment even as exports to the United States decline.  A failure to achieve both types of adjustments could lead to a wave of protectionist  policies that would be in nobody's interest.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110402/ajax/content?token=XnuZhSYEFQPLsT6tM7s66YMlGCTV9QUd8eqJdi90gJI" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
