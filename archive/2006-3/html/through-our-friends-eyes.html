</p>
<p>By Bernard-Henri Lévy. Translated by Charlotte Mandell.
</p>
<p>Überpower: The Imperial Temptation of America.
</p>
<p>By Josef Joffe.
</p>
<p>Although the administration of George W. Bush seems to have moderated  both the substance and the style of its foreign policy recently, the consequences  of its earlier behavior continue to shape international life. Bush's actions during  his first term, especially the invasion of Iraq, unleashed waves of anti-Americanism,  particularly in Europe and the Middle East. The fallout has greatly complicated  the already difficult task of managing U.S. power in a world grown suspicious of U.S.  ambitions.

</div>
</div><p>Two new books by Europeans firmly in the anti-anti-American camp  shed light on this sorry state of affairs. In American Vertigo, Bernard-Henri Lévy,  a leading French public intellectual and latter-day philosophe, attempts to follow  in the footsteps (often literally) of Alexis de Tocqueville as he explores whether  the United States today is still the democratic, hopeful, and open society of Democracy  in America. In Überpower, Josef Joffe, perhaps the most important strategic  thinker in Germany today, investigates the rise of anti-Americanism worldwide, ponders  its implications for U.S. grand strategy, and prescribes a treatment for Washington's  current foreign policy ills.
</p>
<p>Much of the critical reaction to American Vertigo so far has revealed  that Americans remain morbidly sensitive to slights from respected foreign observers.  The same easily wounded amour-propre that inspired legions of American literati  and newspaper editorialists to denounce nineteenth-century travel writers such as  Fanny Trollope and Charles Dickens has blinded many readers to the true nature of  Lévy's book. Although blasted as the work of an unenlightened and condescending  Euro-snob who fails to grasp the majesty of U.S. democracy, the book is in fact  an artfully constructed, unblinking defense of the United States against European  (especially French) anti-Americanism, a stance all the more remarkable and courageous  in the age of Bush.
</p>
<p>Yes, Lévy waxes self-righteous about his noble and sensitive  opposition to the death penalty. Yes, Lévy finds the mixture of Americans'  puritanical fear of sex and their consumerist obsession with it to be creepy and  disconcerting. Yes, Lévy descants on his opposition to the war in Iraq and  condemns what he considers to be the excesses of neoconservatism in U.S. foreign  policy. But it is easy to see where his deepest sympathies lie.
</p>
<p>Lévy argues, rightly, that the United States has lost neither  its republican instincts nor its democratic soul. Debate and dissent still flourish  there. Civil society remains independent and suspicious of the state. There are  a lot of fundamentalists running around, but they have not turned the country into  the dystopia of Margaret Atwood's novel The Handmaid's Tale. Nor has nationalism  vanquished democracy, although the United States today, as in Tocqueville's time,  is vulnerable to the tyranny of the majority. And despite his disagreements with  right-wing intellectuals such as William Kristol, Lévy admires their attempts  to engage with the world of ideas. Indeed, it is within the American left that he  finds an obsession with money and a near-total absence of ideas.
</p>
<p>THE UGLY ANTI-AMERICANS
</p>
<p>Ironically, Lévy's tribute to the unchangingly democratic  nature of the United States makes one of Tocqueville's concerns more salient. Tocqueville  believed that international affairs was the Achilles' heel of U.S. democracy. He  thought that a successful foreign policy required qualities that democratic societies  generally lack, and that those qualities democracies generally have are worse than  useless when it comes to confronting the dangers of the real world.
</p>
<p>Joffe draws attention to this problem in a very precise and pointed  way in Überpower. Joffe recognizes that a successful U.S. foreign policy would  need to be thoughtful, subtle, and sophisticated -- but he also realizes that it  is questionable whether U.S. public opinion would be able to sustain such a policy.  He argues that anti-Americanism constitutes a major and growing problem for U.S.  foreign policy and, perhaps even more serious, that powers such as China, Russia,  and the European Union are beginning to unite against the United States. An Atlanticist  and anti-anti-American to the core, Joffe feels that these developments are troubling  not only for the United States but for the international community as a whole. There  is important work to be done in the world, he argues, and only the United States  can do it.

</div><p>Joffe maintains that systemic anti-Americanism is akin to a belief  that the United States is in "a permanent state of crime against mankind," in the  words of the twentieth-century French novelist Henri de Montherlant. Joffe identifies  five classic marks of anti-Americanism: reducing Americans to stereotypes, believing  the United States to have an irremediably evil nature, ascribing to the U.S. establishment  a vast conspiratorial power aimed at utterly dominating the globe, holding the United  States responsible for all the evils in the world, and seeking to limit the influence  of the United States by destroying it or by cutting oneself and one's society off  from its polluting products and practices. Joffe cites a number of extremely disturbing  documents, cartoons, and statements from the Arab world demonstrating a full-fledged  ideologically based form of anti-Americanism that displays all five traits. A less  virulent form of the disease has infected Europe, Joffe argues, and he is able to  bring forward an uncomfortable amount of evidence to support his point.
</p>
<p>Students of modern German history will note resemblances between  the anti-Americanism Joffe describes today and the anti-Semitism of the Nazis. Joffe  welcomes the comparison. In both Europe and the Arab world, anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism  frequently travel together, as Joffe ably shows. He believes that the relationship  between the two ideologies stems from the representation of Americans and Jews as  symbols and agents of modernity and globalization. American and Jewish cultures  (exemplified by Hollywood), U.S. and Israeli power, and U.S., Jewish, and Israeli  economic success all permeate the world and force others to adapt. As a result,  the losers from globalization blame everything they dislike about globalization  and modernity on the Americans and the Jews.
</p>
<p>Joffe's argument fairly neatly explains regional variations in  levels of anti-Americanism. In Latin America and the Arab world, where the costs  of globalization and modernity loom large and their benefits seem difficult or impossible  for ordinary people to grasp, anti-Americanism is potent. In Europe, where the experience  of globalization and modernity has been less negative, there are growing fears not  only that the increased competition of the U.S.-led international economy will overwhelm  the European social model, but also that the rise of Asia will further endanger  Europe's place in the world. And one finds perhaps the deepest hatred toward the  United States outside of the Muslim world among certain strata of Russians who still  resent the loss of the influence they enjoyed during the Soviet empire.
</p>
<p>But other regions have had different experiences. In India and  China, for instance, large numbers among both the elite and the population at large  have come to view globalization and modernity, and thus to some degree the United  States, more favorably. As both countries have opened up to the world economy, their  poverty rates have fallen while incomes have increased, and their ranks in the international  pecking order have risen. In India, once a hotbed of dependency theorists, strategists  of nonalignment, and Marxist critics of all things American, there has been a dramatic  and widespread decline in anti-Americanism in recent years. A poll conducted by  the BBC in January 2005 showed that 64 percent of respondents in India believed  that Bush's reelection in 2004 made the world safer. In China, Japan has replaced  the United States as the primary object of nationalist ire. Plenty of opposition  to specific U.S. policies remains in both countries -- especially to the Iraq war  in India and to U.S. support for Taiwan in China. But at least in China, the atmosphere  is noticeably freer of the kind of all-encompassing anti-Americanism present after  the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.
</p>
<p>BOND THEM LIKE BISMARCK
</p>
<p>Joffe never quite defines the connections between anti-Americanism,  the hatred and fear of capitalist modernity that uses Americans (and sometimes Jews)  as scapegoats, and international great-power opposition to the United States. He  clearly worries, however, that heightened anti-Americanism will facilitate the efforts  of lesser powers to contain the United States. To avoid such an outcome, Joffe argues  that the United States must "balance like Britain," "bond like Bismarck," and supply  international public goods (IPGs).
</p>
<p>Joffe contends that just as the United Kingdom maintained the balance  of power in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the United States  needs to be a force for stability not only in Asia, where it must limit Beijing's  aspirations, but in much of the rest of the world. Even Europe still needs U.S.  involvement, Joffe writes, because European reconciliation continues to depend on  the security structures the United States erected during the Cold War. And Joffe  proposes that just as Bismarck sought to prevent an anti-German coalition by forming  deep ties with both Austria and Russia, the United States should work with Russia  and China to form a strategic triangle and serve as the central power in a "hub-and-spokes"  arrangement that keeps India and Pakistan off a collision course.
</p>
<p>But these strategies will not be enough by themselves to secure  U.S. primacy. Although the United States is far more powerful than any other international  actor, it will fail to achieve its goals if other countries do not see its power  as legitimate. Joffe quotes the dictum of Council on Foreign Relations President  Richard Haass that "the United States does not need the world's permission to act,  but it does need the world's support to succeed." The United States can bolster  its legitimacy by producing IPGs that other states want. Much of international  security, for example, is an IPG provided by the United States, as are various  economic public goods, such as monetary stability and a liberal trading order. An  Atlanticist such as Joffe is well aware of the degree to which the production of  IPGs was a major element in U.S. strategy during the Cold War. Because the United  States historically placed a higher priority on IPGs than the United Kingdom  under Lord Palmerston or Germany under Bismarck did, it became a greater power than  either ever was.
</p>
<p>On this point, however, Joffe shifts from admiring analyst to critic.  Since 9/11, he writes, the United States has "flagged as an investor in global public  goods." The United States is relying increasingly on bilateral trade deals rather  than strengthening the multilateral system, dodging or disregarding international  institutions that do not help it, and allowing its trade deficit to continue to  expand. And Joffe notes that the international community sees many U.S. policies,  such as certain aspects of the war on terrorism, as international public bads. These  "public bads" heighten opposition to U.S. power.
</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
            googletag.cmd.push(function() {

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>Joffe urges the United States to get back to the business of producing  IPGs, which will ultimately reconcile other countries to its primacy. Providing  these goods is tough and lonely work, as Joffe recognizes. The United States had  to make major investments in institutions such as NATO and the UN to put them  on their feet, shouldering more than its share of the burdens and allowing other  countries to reap disproportionate portions of the rewards. Those were painful steps,  but Joffe believes more such moves are necessary now. "To endure in the 21st century,"  Joffe concludes, "this hegemon must soften the hard edge of its power with the world's  consent. Otherwise the 'cittie upon a hill' will be a high, but lonely place." Or  as Jesus says in the Gospel of Mark, "If any man desire to be first, the same shall  be last of all, and servant of all."
</p>
<p>Such sentiments are beautiful, moving, and even true to a degree.  But they leave tough questions unanswered. The changes in U.S. policy that Joffe  recommends -- strengthening the multilateral trading system, providing a more effective  security umbrella, promoting smoother political and economic relations among key  developing countries -- would almost certainly accelerate the rate at which capitalism  is changing the world. And if Joffe's argument about the origins of anti-Americanism  is correct (it is largely persuasive), such policies would fan the flames of the  ideologues' anger in many regions. The European social model would be even more  endangered, and European governments, worried about both their immigrant populations  and their homegrown opponents to globalization à l'américaine, might  well find it difficult or impossible to take a frankly pro-American line. Worse, in  the eyes of Joffe's anti-Americans, Israel would likely be a prime beneficiary of  a more liberal and dynamic international order, while the Arab world would fall  further behind. In this scenario, the glittering skyscrapers of a prosperous West  might become ever more compelling targets for radicalized fanatics unhinged by the  consequences of U.S.-led modernization and globalization. Offering more of America  to those who hate the America they already have will not produce the calming effect  on world politics that Joffe desires.
</p>
<p>Moreover, U.S. voters, who have elected Bush on two occasions  (well, one and a half), are probably unwilling to undertake the diligent, determined,  and self-denying multilateral institution building that Joffe wants. Recent polling  by the Pew Research Center on the American public's attitudes toward U.S. foreign  policy found that although elites favor supporting the production of various high-toned  IPGs, the foreign policy priorities of the public as a whole are (in descending  order) defending the country against terrorism, protecting U.S. jobs, curbing the  proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stopping the spread of AIDS, promoting  U.S. energy independence, fighting drug trafficking, and controlling illegal immigration.  These findings offer little encouragement either to neoconservatives seeking to wage  more wars to make the world safe for democracy or to liberal internationalists such  as Joffe who want the United States to provide more IPGs.
</p>
<p>MUDDLING THROUGH
</p>
<p>Joffe's nightmare is a world that still needs the leadership that  only the United States can provide but where other powers are working to bring it  down. This seems unlikely. Any ranking of great powers in the coming decades would  put China, India, and Japan in second, third, and fourth places, although not necessarily  in that order. Conflict between the United States and any combination of these three  seems increasingly improbable. The rise of India, the economic recovery of Japan,  and the continuing development of middle powers in Asia have made a bid for hegemony  less attractive to China and thus the prospect of such an attempt less alarming  to the United States. At the same time, Asia's increasing economic power will assure  both China and India that U.S. influence in the region is unlikely to be stifling.  And although Bush and the war in Iraq are unpopular in Japan, the Japanese public  seems broadly content with a foreign policy that is closely aligned with the United  States on strategic issues. What is more plausible than the coalition of anti-American  great powers that Joffe fears is that a lesser power -- Russia, perhaps -- may look  to organize a coalition of all who are discontented, in debt, or otherwise demoralized  and depressed. Such a group would be both disagreeable and dangerous, but its formation  would not be a catastrophe.
</p>
<p>When considering the future of U.S. foreign policy, Lévy's  instinct to look back to Tocqueville's era makes sense. When Tocqueville visited  the United States in 1831-32, the country's public opinion and democratic system  seemed poorly adjusted to the requirements of diplomacy. Yet since Tocqueville's  day, the U.S. political system has consistently managed (although rarely on the  first attempt) to muster sufficient public support for international policies that  worked reasonably well in increasingly complex and demanding circumstances. The  best prognosis is more of the same. The United States often makes mistakes, but  it generally manages to do what it must even if it often fails to do all that it  should. One hopes that it will continue to benefit from the counsel and perspective  of the European Atlanticist intelligentsia who have played such a conspicuous and  honorable role in the creation of the most free, most peaceful, and most stable  international community in human history.
