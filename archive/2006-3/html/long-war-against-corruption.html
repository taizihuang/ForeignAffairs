<p>Since the mid-1990s, the issue of corruption has  gained a prominent place on the global agenda. International organizations, including  the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the UN, have  adopted conventions requiring that their members enact laws prohibiting bribery  and extortion. International financial agencies, notably the World Bank, have announced  programs aimed at ensuring fair and open contracting for their projects and stopping  misappropriation by government officials. Most nations have enacted some type of anticorruption  law. International business groups have promulgated model codes of behavior, and  multinational corporations (MNCs) now claim to be implementing antibribery programs.  The leading nongovernmental organization (NGO) in this area, Transparency International,  has conducted analysis and advocacy through chapters in over 90 nations. The international  media report instances of corruption in high places virtually every day (often at  great risk).</p>
<p>Underlying these changes in rules, rhetoric,  and awareness is the growing recognition that bribery and extortion have demonstrably  deleterious consequences. Gone is the day when some pundits seriously argued that  corruption was an efficient corrective for overregulated economies or that it should  be tolerated as an inevitable byproduct of intractable forces. The true impact of  corruption is now widely acknowledged: corruption distorts markets and competition,  breeds cynicism among citizens, undermines the rule of law, damages government legitimacy,  and corrodes the integrity of the private sector. It is also a major barrier to  international development -- systemic misappropriation by kleptocratic governments  harms the poor.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to quantify  global corruption, there is little question that huge problems exist. For example,  the World Bank estimated in 2004 that public officials worldwide receive more than  $1 trillion in bribes each year (and that figure does not include embezzlement).  A 2005 survey by the Russian think tank Indem found that more than $300 billion  in bribes is paid in Russia annually (a ten-fold increase since the last survey,  in 2001) and that more than half of all Russians have at some point been asked for  a payoff. According to the 2005 Volcker report (a report on the UN's former oil-for-food  program by an independent committee headed by the economist Paul Volcker), more  than 2,000 companies participating in the oil-for-food program -- almost half of  the total -- may have been involved in kickback schemes. And the drumbeat of scandals  continues, with events in China, Indonesia, Kenya, Russia, and the United States  leading the news during the past year.</p>
<p>Given vast, continuing problems, the  anticorruption movement will maintain its credibility and momentum only if it can  translate its rhetoric into action and prevent and punish misbehavior in a more  focused and systematic manner. In the near term, the implementation of anticorruption  measures must come in important part from international organizations, developed  nations, and MNCs. Developing nations also have a critical role to play. But their  legal, political, and economic systems vary greatly -- they are failed or failing,  fragile or rising -- and so anticorruption initiatives in the developing world will  have to be a part of, and dependent on, each country's broad, complex, and often  lengthy state-building process.</p>

</div><p>POLYMORPHOUSLY CORRUPT</p>
<p>Corruption takes many forms. It has a supply  side (private bribers) and a demand side (public officials). There is grand corruption,  involving high-level officials with discretionary authority over government policy,  and petty corruption, involving lower-level officials who control access to basic  services such as education and electricity. There is the dynamic between the developed  nations that are a main source of the funds and the developing nations that host  the majority of the officials who extort and misappropriate. Ultimately, addressing  all aspects of the issue is vital because they feed into one another.</p>
<p>Tackling this multifaceted problem, and understanding  how near-term priorities fit into long-term approaches, requires pursuing four types  of measures. First is enforcement, which seeks to deter future misconduct by investigating  and prosecuting existing corruption. Second is prevention: the enactment and implementation  of legislation and administrative regulations that choke off corrupt practices (such  measures should include ombudsman systems, whistleblower protection laws, transparent  rules of procurement and accounting, freedom-of-information laws, auditing and internal-control  requirements for public and private entities, and anti-money-laundering regimes).  Third is the much more complex process of state building, which consists of institutional  reforms designed to create a society of laws, not men, and to build a transparent,  accountable, and durable legal, economic, and political foundation. Finally, there  is the cultural dimension of anticorruption, which involves transmitting positive  values and norms that can strengthen the enforcement, prevention, and state-building  measures.</p>
<p>A comprehensive anticorruption program  must encompass all four of these approaches. But for now, a sharper, narrower focus  is one key to progress. The forces that perpetuate the problem -- money, greed,  power, and institutional weakness -- are potent. International organizations, key  developed nations, and MNCs have the means to counter them if they can end the hypocrisy  of adopting high-toned rhetoric without taking much real action. To do that, they  need leaders who can fight institutional inertia and complicity and can mobilize  those on the inside who already are steadfast proponents of integrity. One area  of near-term emphasis must be the implementation of enforcement and prevention measures  by developed nations, where bribery of foreign officials can be more readily exposed  and prosecuted. The enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, for example,  has had an important impact on the behavior and culture of many U.S. and foreign  corporations covered by the law. A second important near-term measure is to embed  anticorruption practices in international financial agencies and reduce bribery  and misappropriation in their most visible development programs.</p>
<p>LEVERAGING FINANCE</p>
<p>It is now widely recognized that corruption  has undermined international development programs. In The Fate of Africa, Martin  Meredith notes that out of the more than 50 countries on the continent today, only  South Africa and Botswana are better off than those African countries freed from  colonialism were four decades ago, despite hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign  aid. Massive embezzlement and extortion by officials in recipient countries, weak  financial administration, and lack of oversight have limited the effect of international  assistance. Corruption by officials in international financial institutions has also  hurt. Developed countries may be wary of financing new programs, such as the next  round of the UN Millennium Challenge Account or the $50 billion program to aid Africa  proposed by the group of eight highly industrialized states (G-8), unless they are  credibly assured that effective corruption controls are in place.</p>
<p>Former World Bank President James Wolfensohn  ended decades of studied silence on the subject by making corruption the centerpiece  of his address at the 1996 World Bank annual meeting. Since then, the World Bank  has done excellent work analyzing the problem's dimensions and dynamics. Now, anticorruption  must be made a priority at the operational level. This will require overcoming several  obstacles. The power of the World Bank president is hampered by the organization's  decentralized administration and many entrenched fiefdoms. Some staffers consider  lending and granting money their primary role, and so for them, holding up funds  because of corruption concerns goes against the grain. Recipient governments may  refuse to cooperate with reform or pay lip service to new policies while continuing  illicit practices.</p>

    </script>
</div>
</div><p>In order to achieve real change, the  World Bank and other international financial institutions, including regional development  banks, the UN Development Program (UNDP), and bilateral aid agencies, will have  to establish effective controls both within their own organizations and in the projects  they fund. As part of its routine due diligence, the World Bank should identify  a project's corruption risks before committing to fund it. Bidders on World Bank  projects should be required to have effective antibribery compliance programs, and  procurement should be conducted under transparent procedures. Full disclosure of  any financial support for a project and of any agents used by the parties involved  should be made in both recipient and donor countries. All international financial  institutions should develop and exercise strong auditing, investigative, and sanctioning  powers and develop procedures to terminate projects and blacklist parties when warranted.</p>
<p>Although applying anticorruption rules  to specific programs is increasingly necessary to sustain support for international  financing, there is also the more complex and contentious issue of what to do about  governments so corrupt that no safeguard will prevent graft in them. In the case  of humanitarian crises brought on by a tsunami, an earthquake, or an epidemic, aid  may be provided through third parties outside government structures, such as the  International Committee of the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. But because  they have limited funds and face unlimited demand, international financial institutions  might have to conduct a form of economic triage, disbursing money only to those  needy nations where it is less likely to be stolen. Doing so might be a sensible  and necessary approach to foreign assistance, but it creates a problem: one ignores  corrupt states that are failed or failing at one's peril, because they are incubators  of terrorism, the narcotics trade, money laundering, human trafficking, and other  global crime -- raising issues far beyond corruption.</p>
<p>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM</p>
<p>A major achievement of the past decade has  been the adoption of several international treaties designed to fill gaps in existing  national anticorruption laws, including an OECD convention that applies to industrialized  countries; three regional conventions covering Europe, the Americas, and Africa;  and, most recently, the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). Ensuring compliance  with these treaties is critical. Because the bodies overseeing the conventions have  no enforcement powers, follow-up monitoring programs are essential to determine  whether governments fully enact and implement the conventions' provisions. Such  monitoring, which would involve disclosing governments' failures and calling for  corrective action, thus creating publicity and peer pressure, is the only tool available  to hold member states to their undertakings. And it could be conducted with small  staffs and modest budgets.</p>
<p>The scope of the OECD convention -- which  criminalizes the bribery of foreign public officials -- is narrow, but the document  is important nonetheless, because the 36 states that have signed it are home to  most of the major MNCs. The OECD's Working Group on Bribery runs a strong monitoring  program that involves country visits by experts from peer governments and meetings  with local prosecutors and representatives from the private sector and civil society.  Reviews probe OECD states to determine whether their governments have legal loopholes  (such as short statutes of limitations), whether they provide sufficient resources  for enforcement, and whether local corporations have adequate compliance programs.  Over two-thirds of all OECD parties, including the group of seven highly industrialized  states (G-7), have been reviewed, and the working group has demonstrated its credibility  by criticizing the convention's inadequate implementation in major countries such  as France, Japan, Italy, and the United Kingdom. It is essential that OECD monitoring  continue beyond 2007, when current funding is scheduled to end. The working group's  monitoring budget should also be increased so that the group can promptly perform  follow-up visits to noncompliant states and build momentum for greater enforcement.</p>
<p>The OECD should also strengthen its  coverage of the foreign subsidiaries of MNCs -- a need made clear by the Volcker  report, which raised issues about many foreign subsidiaries of companies incorporated  in OECD countries. It should also broaden its coverage beyond the bribery of public  officials to include the bribery of officials from foreign political parties. Both changes  can be achieved without amending the convention; the OECD working group need only  publish an "interpretative commentary," a technique it has used for other issues.</p>
<p>In contrast to the OECD convention,  UNCAC can create a truly global framework for combating corruption because its 140  signatories include both developed and developing nations. It also covers a much  broader scope of issues: extortion in addition to bribery, payoffs to the private  sector as well as to public officials, and both domestic and foreign corruption. UNCAC  also includes a wide range of preventive measures, including the establishment of  anticorruption agencies, anti-money-laundering rules, conflict-of-interest laws,  legal assistance among states for the extradition of suspects and for evidence-gathering  abroad, and the means to recover funds deposited by corrupt officials in foreign banks.</p>
<p>But UNCAC is still in an early phase  of its evolution: it entered into effect in December 2005 and has so far been ratified  by just over a third of its signatories. A priority is to push for ratification  in more states, particularly industrialized nations. The White House has submitted  the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Although there is no organized opposition  to ratification in the United States, some U.S. lawmakers doubt the effectiveness  of the UN overall, especially now that the organization's credibility has been damaged  by the Volcker report. Still, lawmakers should recognize that responsibility for  UNCAC is assigned to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, which has a good reputation  for professionalism.</p>
<p>Another key challenge with UNCAC will  be to establish an effective monitoring program. The breadth of the treaty and the  large number of parties to it make monitoring UNCAC both more important and more  difficult than monitoring the OECD convention. In addition, monitoring is more controversial  among the parties to UNCAC than among the parties to the OECD convention. Two obstacles,  in particular, will have to be overcome at the Conference of States Parties to UNCAC  scheduled for December 2006. First, many developing-country governments are concerned  that monitoring would expose deficiencies they cannot correct. To meet such concerns,  the UNDP, the World Bank, and other international financial institutions should  promise technical assistance to nations that are willing to enact and implement  the treaty's provisions. Second, some industrialized countries are concerned that  UNCAC monitoring would duplicate similar efforts under the OECD convention and regional  anticorruption conventions. To reassure them that this will not happen, cooperation  and coordination among the different programs must become a priority beginning in  2007. It will take the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, committed governments, and engaged  stakeholders years of hard work to make UNCAC effective. But the importance of creating  a worldwide anticorruption framework justifies the effort.</p>

</div>
</div><p>The Council of Europe, the Organization  of American States, and the African Union have also adopted broad anticorruption  conventions. The Asian Development Bank, in cooperation with the OECD's Development  Assistance Committee, has launched an anticorruption initiative in Asia. The G-8  is promoting a similar effort for the Middle East and North Africa. The Council of  Europe, in particular, has done excellent work helping to strengthen anticorruption  practices in central and eastern Europe, illustrating the value of regional conventions.  But regional programs also need adequate funding and follow-up monitoring. And as  the implementation of UNCAC progresses, overlaps with regional conventions must  be eliminated through a clear division of responsibilities.</p>
<p>BEGINS AT HOME</p>
<p>The most effective, immediate way to fight  global corruption is to accelerate the enforcement of national anticorruption laws  in all 36 states that have signed the OECD convention. As the enforcement of anticorruption  laws in the United States shows, companies respond to the threat of prosecution  by changing their programs and culture. Much still needs to be done. A March 2005  study by Transparency International -- covering 24 OECD countries during the time  since they ratified the OECD convention -- showed that the enforcement of antibribery  measures had begun in only 15 countries; that there had been no enforcement action  in nine countries; that only seven countries have two or more serious investigations  under way; and that France, South Korea, Spain, and the United States are the only  four states to have brought more than one prosecution.</p>
<p>Improving enforcement at the national level  requires overcoming misdirected "industrial policies." When governments fight international  trade battles on behalf of their national champions, they often are reluctant to  crack down on the bribery of foreign officials, which can help their companies secure  deals. But trade promotion and anticorruption need not be antithetical; governments  should insist on compliance with anticorruption norms before giving trade-promotion  support. Failing to do so may be politically expedient, but it is indefensible from  a public policy perspective. It is also contrary to accepted values and actions  regarding other transnational criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, intellectual  property theft, money laundering, organized crime, and terrorism.</p>
<p>Effective anticorruption enforcement  also requires proper organization and resources. Investigating and prosecuting cases  can be expensive and time-consuming because they often require specialized forensics  in, for example, accounting and money laundering. A centralized national office -- or  at least some sort of national coordination -- is critical to such efforts. Although  13 of the 24 countries examined in Transparency International's 2005 report have  centralized enforcement, some major players, such as Germany, Italy, Japan, and  the United Kingdom, have not.</p>
<p>To complement formal enforcement measures,  developed nations must also take preventive actions, for example, by instituting  whistleblower protection laws, government hot lines, and new accounting and auditing  requirements. Another important change would be to encourage corporations to voluntarily  disclose evidence of bribery that they uncover during internal audits or through  ombudsman activities. In exchange for reporting both supply- and demand-side corruption  issues, corporations at fault (although not culpable individuals) should receive  more lenient sanctions in settlements. Although more lenient, the sanctions could  require that the corporations set up internal controls subject to court supervision.  Additionally, leading nations should agree to issue standardized annual reports  disclosing the number of anticorruption investigations and cases under way, as well  as the progress that has been made on preventive measures. States that failed to  do this would expose themselves to questions and criticism.</p>
<p>THE CORPORATE CARD</p>
<p>Effective compliance programs within MNCs,  which often are the sources of bribes and the targets of extortion, are a fundamental  building block of the anticorruption movement, and they could be a model for emerging  global companies based in developing nations. Such programs must start with an anticorruption  policy that prohibits both public and private bribes and extortion in all relations  (procurement, transactions, sales) and in all forms (political "contributions,"  improper travel or living expenses for business partners). Effective compliance also  requires robust systems that can educate and train staff, detect problems through  internal auditors and an honest ombudsman system, investigate allegations of corruption  quickly and thoroughly, sanction guilty parties regardless of where they are on  the corporate ladder, and fix the practices that caused the problem. Beyond such  measures, corporate leaders must create a culture of compliance that brooks no winks  and nods and no double talk and that fosters the desire to "do the right thing."  They must communicate three basic propositions to their staffs: that bribery corrodes  the internal culture of a company; that corruption can injure, sometimes fatally,  management, the company, and its stakeholders; and that bribery undermines the processes  of globalization on which growth depends.</p>
<p>Increasingly, corporations are disclosing  their compliance policies and procedures on "integrity" Web sites or in "citizenship"  reports, which shareholders and other stakeholders can review. To allow verification  of the information corporations supply, an independent organization should be developed  to conduct detailed surveys of compliance programs in the top 500 to 1,000 MNCs.  The reports would ask these corporations detailed questions about their anticorruption  policies and seek supporting documentation -- a practice similar to the now-familiar  evaluations performed by corporate-governance watchdogs. They would indicate the  extent of each company's anticorruption program and identify the companies that  chose not to participate. Such a project could be shaped and endorsed by the MNCs  that are leaders in anticorruption compliance programs today; they have the credibility  to explain why such programs are in the best interest of MNCs and how they can create  a competitive advantage rather than be a drag on commercial activity.</p>

            });
    
    </script>
</div>
</div><p>International companies should also  participate in forums to discuss problems of compliance with the officials and business  leaders of developing countries, and especially with the leaders of those enterprises  seeking to become global players. To promote anticorruption measures, they should  also participate openly and honestly in the policymaking process in both developed  and developing countries. These measures, if properly conceived and implemented,  would help create a level playing field for both foreign and local competitors -- a  key goal of globalization.</p>
<p>POLITICS AND POLICIES</p>
<p>The most important question facing the anticorruption  movement today is how to create a politics that can make the policies of enforcement  and prevention effective and change the mindset of international institutions, developed  nations, and MNCs. Each institutional actor will have to overcome its long-standing  internal cultural problems. To make financial discipline operational, international  financial institutions must change the perspective of those staff members who, eager  to push money out the door, oppose conditioning loans or grants on securing commitments  from beneficiaries to fight corruption. The OECD working group and other entities  that are charged with implementing anticorruption conventions but that have no enforcement  power must use monitoring to goad their member states into compliance while continuing  to secure needed budgetary support from those states. Developed nations must show  the political will to investigate and prosecute their national corporations when  they engage in bribery abroad, even in the face of intense global competition. Finally,  MNCs must overcome short-term economic pressures and old ways of doing business  so as to create and sustain an anticorruption culture and effective corporate compliance  procedures.</p>
<p>All of these changes will require new pressure  from below and new leadership from above. The media and NGOs must continue to keep  anticorruption high on the global agenda. In this age of instantaneous communications,  it has become harder to hide wrongdoing: corrupt officials and businesspeople are  now exposed by private whistleblowers, government leakers, aggrieved competitors,  and investigative reporters. Publicity is an important deterrent because corruption  can terminate careers. During the past year alone, scandals have brought down the  prime minister of Ukraine, the deputy president of South Africa, the leader of Brazil's  ruling party, key Kenyan government ministers, and the majority leader of the U.S.  House of Representatives. But systematic changes are necessary to ensure that corruption  scandals stop repeating themselves like a prurient TV show on rerun.</p>
<p>When effectively carried out, individual  actions can be mutually reinforcing: Monitoring the implementation of international  conventions could stimulate enforcement by national prosecutors. More prosecutions  could persuade MNCs to conduct more rigorous corporate compliance programs. The  curbing of corruption among MNCs could promote support for international monitoring -- and  needed prevention programs -- thus bringing lagging governments and their companies  into line. This chain of events could accelerate change in the culture of key corporations,  government agencies, and international institutions -- and become an important cornerstone  for broader state building in the developing world.</p>
<p>But virtuous cycles are difficult to  start. Part of the challenge is the size and complexity of the anticorruption agenda.  Leaders must set achievable goals in order to mobilize their organizations. Leadership  changes have occurred or are about to occur in key entities: the World Bank, the  OECD, the UN, Transparency International, and the International Chamber of Commerce.  The resulting set of new leaders should get together with NGOs and leaders from  other key organizations, such as export-credit entities and international law-enforcement  agencies, to map out a broad anticorruption strategy and develop a consensus for  near-term and middle-term action. Attempts at high-level consensus building might,  of course, yield merely platitudes or equivocation. But it is also possible that  the exercise could launch the new politics necessary at this crossroads in the development  of the anticorruption movement.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most potent force for  change is the idea that corruption is morally repugnant and inimical to competition,  globalization, the rule of law, international development, and the welfare of citizens  around the world. During the past decade, many public- and private-sector actors  have paid lip service to the idea that fighting corruption is in both their own  interest and the interest of the global good. Now they must act.</p><a class="use-ajax" href="/fa/paywall/1110401/ajax/content?token=RG0btCHIrCwmqjTAeSkqHl4u8yONz30NeBqYUD1NM-0" id="fa-paywall-js--fetch-content"></a><div class="loading-indicator" role="alert"><span class="loader loader-quart"></span>Loading...<br/><noscript><span>Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.</span>
